This section describes how to implement common statistical tests in R both without and with weights and survey design information. A working knowledge of these tests and their theoretical assumptions is assumed.

## Differences between means

Two common ways of conducting significance testing consist in testing  whether  sample means significantly differ from 0 (one  sample t-test), or between  two  groups (two samples t test). In the latter case, one can further distinguish between independent samples (where means come from different groups), or paired  samples (when the same measure is taken at several points in time). Given that it is probably one of the most widely used statistical tests in social sciences, we will only cover the former here. Several R packages provide functions for conducting t tests. We will be using `t.test()`, provided by the `stats` package (R Base). 

Suppose we would like to test whether the libertarianism vs authoritarianism score `libauth` significantly differs between men and women using a t test. A two sided test is the default, with H_0 or the null hypothesis being that there are  no differences between groups, and H_1 or the alternative hypothesis that the  group means do indeed differ. The test is specified with a formula with on the left-hand side the quantity to be tested and on the right-hand side the grouping variable. 

One sided tests can be conducted by specifying that the alternative hypothesis (H_1) is that  quantities are  either **greater** or **smaller**. `t.test()` assumes that by default the variances are unequal. This can be changed with the `var.equal=T` option.

```{r 8.1}
# Testing for significant differences in liberal vs authoritarian score
summary(
t.test(libauth~Rsex.f,
       data=bsa)
)
```
No significant differences (ie the difference in  `libauth` between men and women is not significantly different from zero)
```{r 8.2}

# Testing for whether men have a lower (ie more left-wing)  score
t.test(leftrigh~Rsex.f,
       data=bsa, 
       alternative="less")      
```
Men have a significantly lower  score on the scale (at the .05 threshold)  and are therefore on average leaning more to the left than women.

The result of the above  tests may be biased as they do not account for bias from either sample design or non-response. When results representative of the British population are required, a survey designed informed version of the t test should be used. The `survey` package that we used earlier in Chapter 6 provides such a function. 

```{r 8.3}
library(survey)
bsa.design<-svydesign(ids =~1,           # Declaring the survey design
                      weights=~WtFactor,
                      data=bsa) 

svyttest(libauth~Rsex.f,bsa.design)   # SD informed t-test of libauth by gender

svyttest(leftrigh~Rsex.f,bsa.design) # SD informed t-test of leftrigh by gender
```
In this case the output of `svyttest()` did not lead to a different conclusion than the one we drew above. However, we can notice that the significance of differences in political affiliation has decreased.



## Differences in variance

Another common significance test in social science is the **variance test** which consists of  testing whether the variances of the same variable across two groups  are equal. This is usually achieved by testing whether the ratio of the variance between the two groups is significantly different from zero. With the BSA data, this amounts to testing whether men and women are more homogeneous with regard to their political views.

The syntax for the variance test `var.test()` also included in `stats` is almost identical to that of `t.test()`

```{r 8.4}
# Testing for gender differences in liberal vs authoritarian score
var.test(libauth~Rsex.f,
         data=bsa)
```
Significant differences in the variance  between men and women was observed, but only at the .1 threshold.
```{r 8.4.1}

# Testing for whether men have a lower (ie more left-wing)  score
var.test(leftrigh~Rsex.f,
         data=bsa,
         alternative="greater")      
```
The variance of left-right political leaning is larger among men than women, in other words there are more divergence between men than between women.



## Significance of measures of association

### Between continuous variables {-}
  
  Another common statistical test in social science  examines whether a coefficient of correlation is significantly different from 0 (alternative hypothesis).

```{r 8.5}
cor.test(bsa$leftrigh, bsa$libauth, 
         use='complete.obs')
```

As we could have suspected, the correlation coefficient   between the two scales is too small  to be considered significantly  different from zero.

### Between categorical variables {-}

Let us go back to an earlier example, and test whether gender differences in political affiliations are due to chance or not using a chi-squared test of independence . 
  
The chi-squared test is a very common  test of association between categorical variables. It consists in examining whether a pattern of association between two variables is likely to be random or not, in other words whether the variability observed in a contingency table is significantly different from what could be expected were it due to chance.

We will be using `chisq.test()`, also  from the `stats` package. By contrast with the test of correlation, the `chisq.test()` needs to be applied to  contingency tables that have already been computed separately.




```{r 8.6}
t<-xtabs(~PartyId2.f +Rsex.f,bsa)
chisq.test(t)
```


As the R output shows, there are highly significant gender differences in political affiliations (p<.001).

Does this remain true if we account for the survey design, as we did above for the t test? The `survey` package also has a survey design version of the chi square test:

```{r 8.7}
svychisq(~PartyId2.f +Rsex.f, # We directly specify the contingency table here
         bsa.design,        
          statistic = "Chisq" # And we specify the kind of test we would like
         )
```
Interestingly this time, when accounting for survey design, sampling and non-response, gender differences in political affiliations are not significant anymore.

#### Visualising association in contingency tables with mosaic plots {-}


In the previous chapter we used mosaic plots for representing contingency tables of political party affiliation by gender. A nice feature of these plots is that they can also  be used to  visualise significant deviations between observed and expected values. 

This relies on  a function specified with the `gp=` option which defines the  shading of the colours of the respective cells according to the size of these deviations fom expected values, also known as residuals. Thresholds for shading can be customised as required.



```{r 8.8}
#| fig.height: 6
mosaic(t,                            
       shade=T,
       gp = shading_hsv,               # shading function
       labeling=labeling_border(
         rot_labels = c(0,0,0,0),      # no label rotation on any plot facet
         varname=F,                    # no  variable names on the plot
         just_labels="left",           # labels left justified
         gp_labels=gpar(fontsize = 12),# label font size
         offset_labels = c(0, 0, 0, 3) # margins between label and plot facet
         ),
main = "Unweighted mosaic plot of party affiliation by gender" # Plot title
         )
```
The red and blue shaded rectangles in the figure above denote respectively  lower and higher numbers of observations than expected if the two variables were independent from each other.

Another convenient  feature of `mosaic()` is that it readily accepts weighted contingency tables produced by the `survey` package. If we repeat what we did in Chapter 6, namely, declare the survey design, and perform a survey design-informed chi square test, we can then feed the weighted  frequencies computed by `svychisq` into the mosaic plot.

```{r 8.9}
library(survey) ### Loading the package in memory
bsa.design<-svydesign(ids =~1,
                      weights=~WtFactor,
                      data=bsa) 
t<-svychisq(~PartyId2.f+Rsex.f,bsa.design,statistic = "Chisq")$observed
```

The plot below does not display shades of blue or red anymore, reflecting the fact that the weighted distributions of political party affiliation and gender are  weakly associated.

```{r 8.10}
#| fig.height: 6

mosaic(t,                            
       shade=T,
       gp = shading_hcl,
       labeling=labeling_border(
         rot_labels = c(0,0,0,0),
         varname=F,
         just_labels="left",
         gp_labels=gpar(fontsize = 12),
         offset_labels = c(0, 0, 0, 3)
),
main = "Weighted mosaic plot of party affiliation by gender"

)
```
