These include logistic regression, and more generally models falling under the Generalized Linear Model framework.  \nIn this section, we will use it to investigate the association between the level of education `HEdQual3.f` and `Voted`, whether someone voted or not. Let’s first briefly explore the variables using the `class()` and `table()` commands from the previous chapters:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(bsa$Voted)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"haven_labelled\" \"vctrs_vctr\"     \"double\"        \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(bsa$Voted)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n   1    2 \n2205  776 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nand \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(bsa$HEdQual3.f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"factor\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(bsa$HEdQual3.f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n                          Degree Higher educ below degree/A level \n                            1050                             1086 \n            O level or equiv/CSE                 No qualification \n                            1026                              747 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is a good idea to make sure that  categorical variables are stored as factors. This is not absolutely necessary, but gives greater flexibility, for instance when having to change the reference category on the go.\n\nFor greater readability we can also shorten the levels of `HEdQual3.f`  using the `level()` function:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlevels(bsa$HEdQual3.f) ### The original level names  are a bit verbose...\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Degree\"                           \"Higher educ below degree/A level\"\n[3] \"O level or equiv/CSE\"             \"No qualification\"                \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### ... Fortunately we can shorten them easily\nlevels(bsa$HEdQual3.f) <- c(\"Degree\",\"A level and above\",\"GCSE or equiv\",\"No Qual\")\n\ntable(bsa$HEdQual3.f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n           Degree A level and above     GCSE or equiv           No Qual \n             1050              1086              1026               747 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat about the levels for our dependent variable? By default, the first level of a factor will be used as the reference category. This can be also checked with the `contrasts()`. In this case,  1 is associated with ‘No’, so the model will be predicting the probability of NOT voting. If the 1 was associated with ‘Yes’ then the model will be predicting the probability of voting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbsa$Voted.f<-droplevels(as_factor(bsa$Voted)) # As before, factor conversion\nlevels(bsa$Voted.f) #Note that Yes comes before No\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Yes\" \"No\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontrasts(bsa$Voted.f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    No\nYes  0\nNo   1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we are interested in the latter we need to change the reference category using the `relevel()` function. We can also create a new variable named `Voted2` so as to keep a copy of the original variable intact. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reverse the order\nbsa$Voted2 <- relevel(bsa$Voted.f, ref = \"No\")\n\n#Check the contrasts\ncontrasts(bsa$Voted2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Yes\nNo    0\nYes   1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nSince the outcome  variable (Voted or Voted2) has a binomial distribution, we need to specify to the glm() function that we will be fitting a logistic regression model. We will do this by setting the argument 'family'  to 'binomial' and the link function to 'logit'. We could  also have used 'probit' instead as a link function.\nThe code below runs the model and stores the result into an object called `fit1`:\n  \n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit1 <- glm(Voted2 ~ HEdQual3.f, data=bsa, family=binomial(link=logit))\nsummary(fit1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Voted2 ~ HEdQual3.f, family = binomial(link = logit), \n    data = bsa)\n\nCoefficients:\n                            Estimate Std.

Please refer to the package documentation for more detailed explanations.\n\nRaw logistic regression coefficients measure the effect of variables on the probability of the outcome such as log(betaX)=P(y). It is common practice to  convert these into odd ratios  by exponentiating them, such as that betaX=exp(P(y)).

It is used to compare the improvement in how several models fit some data relative to each other, allowing for the different number of parameters or degrees of freedom. The smaller the AIC, the better the fit. In order for the comparison to be valid, we need to ensure that the models were run with the same number of observations each time. As it is likely that the second model was run on a smaller sample, due to missing values for the Age and Sex variables, we will need to re-run the first one without.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit1 <- glm(Voted2 ~ HEdQual3.f, data=bsa%>%\n              filter(!is.na(Rsex.f) & !is.na(RAgeCat)), family=binomial(link=logit))\n\nc(fit1$aic,fit2$aic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3244.507 2954.532\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see that the model controlling for gender and sex is a better fit to the data than the one without controls as it has an AIC of 2944.5 against 3244.5 for fit1.\n\nWith the information about the deviance from fit1 and fit2, we can also compute the overall significance of the model, that is whether the difference between the deviance (another  likelihood-based measure of fit) for the fitted model is significantly different from that of the empty or null model. This is usually carried by conducting a chi square test, accounting for the differences in the number of parameters (ie degrees of freedom) between the two models. As with other R code, this can achieved step by step or in one go:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndev.d<-fit2$null.deviance - fit2$deviance \ndf.d<-fit2$df.null - fit2$df.residual\np<-1 - pchisq(dev.d, df.d)\nc(dev.d,df.d,p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 350.5509   5.0000   0.0000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe Chi square test indicates that the  difference in deviance of 370.5 with 10 degrees of freedom is highly significant (P<.001) \n\\newpage\n",
