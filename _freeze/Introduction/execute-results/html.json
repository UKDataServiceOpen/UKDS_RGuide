It has a large audience in the science and statistics communities and\nis increasingly used in the social and data sciences for teaching and research. \n\nAnyone can install and use R without charge, and to some extent contribute \nand amend the existing program itself. R can be downloaded from the\n[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) website.\nInstallation instructions as well as guides, tutorials and FAQ are available on\nthe CRAN website. A considerable amount of R-related resources is available online.\n\nR is particularly favoured by users who want to develop their own statistical\nfunctions or implement technical advances that are not yet available in\ncommercial packages. The existence of a vast number of user written packages\n(20,889 at the time of writing this guide)  is one of the strengths of R.\nUsers who want to contribute should be aware that in order to be part of the R\narchive, a minimum set of rules need nonetheless to be followed.\n\nAlthough R can perform most of the analyses available in tradtional statistical software\nsuch as Stata, SPSS, or SAS, it has a broader potential since it can also be\nused for mapping, data mining or machine learning. Being a language also means\nthat there are often several ways to carry out the same analyses in R, each one with its\nadvantages and downsides. Users can also easily produce  publication quality\noutput from R thanks to its integration with the Markdown (now Quarto) and LaTeX document\npresentation systems. R graphs can also easoily be imported into html, MS Word or\nLibreOffice documents.\n\nBy contrast with other statistical software,  the R interface is rather minimal\nand consist merely of a terminal.  In line with  languages such a\nPython or C, R users tend to access it via an programming interface, or Integrated\nDevelopment Environment (IDE).  In this  guide we will be using the R Studio development\nenvironment, one of the most common IDE for R. The data used in this guide is\nthe [British Social Attitudes Survey, 2017, Environment and Politics: Open Access Teaching\n     Dataset](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8849),\nwhich can be downloaded from the UK Data Service website without registration.\nThe website also has instructions on how to acquire and download large-scale\nsurvey datasets. Links and further information about the other training\nresources available online are provided at the end of this document. \n\n\n<!-- ## Pros and cons of R relative to other statistical software -->\n  Although R has advantages over other statistical analysis software, it also has\na few downsides, both of which are summarised below.  Users should be reminded\nthat as open-source software, R and its packages are mainly developed by volunteers,\nwhich makes it a very flexible and dynamic project, but at the same time reliant\non developers’ free time and goodwill.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Advantages and downsides of R\n\n|Pros                                                                                                                                           |Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|R is free and allows users to perform  almost any analysis they want.                                                                          |The learning curve may be steep for users who  do not have a prior background in statistics or  programming.                                                                                                           |\n|R puts statistical analysis closer to the reach of  lay people rather than specialists.                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|Transparency of use and programming of the software  and its routines, which improves the peer-reviewing  and quality control of the software. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|Very flexible.                                                                                                                                 |Problem solving (for both advanced users  and beginners)  may be time-consuming, depending  on how common the problem encountered,  and may lead to more time spent solving  technical rather than substantive issues. |\n|                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|Availability of a wide range of advanced techniques not provided in other statistical software                                                 |Many people who design R packages are,   or will become busy academics.
