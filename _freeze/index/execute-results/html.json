It\nis aimed at two categories of users: \n  \n  1. Those outside higher education, or who do not have access to one commonly used commercial statistical  software such as Stata, SPSS or SAS but who would like to conduct their own analysis beyond what is usually published by data producers such as the Office for National Statistics (for example statistics \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                for specific groups of the population). This guide provides this group of users with a range of procedures that will help them produce straightforward and robust \nanalyses tailored to their needs without spending unnecessary time on learning the inner workings of R. \n\n2. More advanced users who are already familiar with other data analysis tools but who would like to learn how to carry out their analyses in R. \nThe guide therefore focuses on providing succinct  examples of common operations that most users carry out in the course of their research, including how to: \n  \n  - read in and open datasets. \n\n- do common data manipulation operations. \n\n- produce simple descriptive statistics or tabulations. \n\n- use survey weights. \n\nBy contrast with other statistical software,  the R interface is rather minimal\nand consist merely of a terminal.  In line with programming languages such a\nPython or C, R users tend to access it via an interface, or Integrated\nDevelopment Environment (IDE).  This guide uses the R Studio development\nenvironment, one of the most common IDE for R. The data used in this guide is\nthe [British Social Attitudes Survey, 2017, Environment and Politics: Open\n     Access Teaching\n     Dataset](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8849),\nwhich can be downloaded from the UK Data Service website without registration.\nThe website also has instructions on how to acquire and download large-scale\nsurvey datasets. Links and further information about the other training\nresources available online are provided at the end of this document. \n\n## What is R ?\n\nR is a free, user developed, object-oriented statistical programming language\nthat  originates in the ‘S’ and ‘S Plus’ languages developed during the 1970s\nand 1980s. It has a large audience in the science and statistics communities and\nis increasingly used in the social sciences for teaching and research purposes. \n\nAnyone can install and use R without charge, and to some extent contribute to\nand amend the existing program itself. R can be downloaded from the\n[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) website.\nInstallation instructions as well as guides, tutorials and FAQ are available on\nthe CRAN website.\n\nR is particularly favoured by users who want to develop their own statistical\nfunctions or implement technical advances that are not yet available in\ncommercial packages. The existence of a vast number of user written packages\n(17,672 at the time of writing this guide)  is one of the great strengths of R.\nUsers who want to contribute should be aware that in order to be part of the R\narchive, a minimum set of rules need nonetheless to be followed.\n\nAlthough R can perform most of the analyses available in generalist  software\nsuch as Stata, SPSS, or SAS, it has a broader potential since it can also be\nused for mapping, data mining or machine learning. Being a language also means\nthat there are often several ways to carry out analyses in R, each one with its\nadvantages and inconvenient. Users can also easily produce  publication quality\noutput from R thanks to its integration with the Markdown LaTeX document\npresentation system, and R graphs can also be imported into MS Word or\nLibreOffice documents.\n\n<!-- ## Pros and cons of R relative to other statistical software -->\n  Although R has advantages over other statistical analysis software, it also has\na few downsides, both of which are summarised below.  Users should be reminded\nthat as open-source software, R and its packages are developed by volunteers,\nwhich makes it a very flexible and dynamic project, but at the same time reliant\non developers’ free time and goodwill.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/table_3d3352830d3177b9a3d2e6b2bf67e393'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Advantages and inconvenients of R\n\n|Pros                                                                                                                                                         |Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|R is free and allows users to perform  almost any analysis they want.                                                                                        |The learning curve may be steep for users who  do not have a prior background in statistics or  programming.                                                                                                           |\n|R puts statistical analysis closer to the reach of  individual citizens rather than specialists.                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|Transparency of use and programming of the software  and its routines, which improves the peer-reviewing  and quality control of the software in many cases. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|Very flexible.                                                                                                                                               |Problem solving (for both advanced users  and beginners)  may be time-consuming, depending  on how common the problem encountered,  and may lead to more time spent solving  technical rather than substantive issues. |\n|                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|Availability of a wide range of advanced techniques not provided in other statistical software                                                               |Many people who design R packages are,   or will become busy academics.
