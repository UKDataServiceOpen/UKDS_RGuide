It is aimed at two categories of users: \n\nThose outside higher education, or who do not have access to commercial statistical software such as Stata, SPSS or SAS but who would like to conduct their own analysis beyond what is usually published by data producers: for example statistics for specific groups of the population. This guide provides this group of users with a range of procedures that will help them produce straightforward and robust analyses tailored to their needs without spending unnecessary time on learning the inner workings of R. \nMore advanced users who are already familiar with other data analysis tools but who would like to learn how to carry out their analyses in R.\n\nThe guide therefore focuses on providing succinct examples of common operations that most users carry out in the course of their research, including how to:\n\nread in and open datasets.\ndo common data manipulation operations.\nproduce simple descriptive statistics or tabulations.\nhandle survey weights and survey design variables",

    "text": "R is a free, user developed, object-oriented statistical programming language. It originates in the ‘S’ and ‘S Plus’ languages developed during the 1970s and 1980s. It has a large audience in the science and statistics communities and is increasingly used in the social and data sciences for teaching and research.\nAnyone can install and use R without charge, and to some extent contribute and amend the existing program itself. R can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. Installation instructions as well as guides, tutorials and FAQ are available on the CRAN website. A considerable amount of R-related resources is available online.\nR is particularly favoured by users who want to develop their own statistical functions or implement technical advances that are not yet available in commercial packages. The existence of a vast number of user written packages (20,889 at the time of writing this guide) is one of the strengths of R. Users who want to contribute should be aware that in order to be part of the R archive, a minimum set of rules need nonetheless to be followed.\nAlthough R can perform most of the analyses available in tradtional statistical software such as Stata, SPSS, or SAS, it has a broader potential since it can also be used for mapping, data mining or machine learning. Being a language also means that there are often several ways to carry out the same analyses in R, each one with its advantages and downsides. Users can also easily produce publication quality output from R thanks to its integration with the Markdown (now Quarto) and LaTeX document presentation systems. R graphs can also easoily be imported into html, MS Word or LibreOffice documents.\nBy contrast with other statistical software, the R interface is rather minimal and consist merely of a terminal. In line with languages such a Python or C, R users tend to access it via an programming interface, or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In this guide we will be using the R Studio development environment, one of the most common IDE for R. The data used in this guide is the British Social Attitudes Survey, 2017, Environment and Politics: Open Access Teaching Dataset, which can be downloaded from the UK Data Service website without registration. The website also has instructions on how to acquire and download large-scale survey datasets. Links and further information about the other training resources available online are provided at the end of this document.\n\nAlthough R has advantages over other statistical analysis software, it also has a few downsides, both of which are summarised below. Users should be reminded that as open-source software, R and its packages are mainly developed by volunteers, which makes it a very flexible and dynamic project, but at the same time reliant on developers’ free time and goodwill.\n\n\n\nAdvantages and downsides of R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nR is free and allows users to perform almost any analysis they want.\nThe learning curve may be steep for users who do not have a prior background in statistics or programming.\n\n\nR puts statistical analysis closer to the reach of lay people rather than specialists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency of use and programming of the software and its routines, which improves the peer-reviewing and quality control of the software.\n\n\n\nVery flexible.\nProblem solving (for both advanced users and beginners) may be time-consuming, depending on how common the problem encountered, and may lead to more time spent solving technical rather than substantive issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailability of a wide range of advanced techniques not provided in other statistical software\nMany people who design R packages are, or will become busy academics. Packages can stop being maintained without notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very large user base provides abundant documentation, tutorials, and web pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several (sometimes many) ways of achieving a particular result in R. This can be confusing for novice researchers, but at the same time will allow users to tightly adjust their programmes to their needs.",

    "text": "2.1 Download and installation\nR can be downloaded for free from the CRAN website, installed and run like any other application. Versions for Windows, Mac and Linux are available. The standard and rather minimalist interface that appears when the programme is launched is shown below.\nThis interface merely allows the user to type in commands one by one in the console, and to install packages via pull-down menus. This setup is however rather minimal, not very ergonomic or user friendly. As with other statistical software, the primary way of interacting with R for most consist of instead writing code or syntax in files (also called scripts files) that are saved and run whenever needed, which is not directly feasible with the standard R GUI.\nWriting R code and running script files is made easier via an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as RStudio for beginners to intermediate users Sublime Text, or the StatEt module for Eclipse for more advanced programmers. All are free, available for Windows, MacOS and Linux and offer users a large number of functionalities, such as syntax highlighting, integration with Github and Markdown/Quarto, and document visualisation. Given that it probably has the largest number of users and its interface is straightforward for beginners, RStudio will be used in the remainder of this guide. In order for this guide to remain as universal as possible, we will not rely on the advanced features of RStudio, instead using it merely as an interface to the R engine.",

Once downloaded double click on the file and follow the installation instructions.\nBy default, the R Studio interface consists of four main panels, respectively known as the Script Editor (top left panel), the Console (bottom left panel), the Environment (top right panel) and the File/Directory/Help/Viewer (bottom right panel).\n\n\n\nThe R Studio default interface\n\n\nAs this rather complex interface can be visually overwhelming for some users and is not required for the purpose of this guide, we will minimise the Global Environment and Files/Directory/Help panels by clicking in the center of the window and dragging right to the edge of the screen.

    "section": "2.3 Interacting with R",
    "text": "2.3 Interacting with R\nAs already mentioned, one can type R commands directly in the console of RStudio and/or by writing sequences of commands in a script file.\nMost R commands – also known as functions in R jargon – adopt the following syntax:\n\n&gt; command(parameter1, parameter2, ...)\n\nAll R commands are followed by brackets, even if some of them take no parameters.\nIn the following example we are going to set up the default working directory, that is the default location for opening and storing files, by using the getwd() and setwd() commands. First, let us visualise the current default working directory.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/home/mscsepw2/OneDrive/rguide/UKDS_RGuide\"\n\n\nLet us say we would like the code from this guide to be all in a folder called ‘R_UKDS’, to be located in ‘My Documents’. To tell R to use the folder ’R_UKDS, we can either create it from within Windows or ask R to do it for us. So type:\nFor Windows:\n&gt; setwd(\"C:/Documents and Settings/&lt;INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE&gt;/My Documents/R_UKDS\")\nFor Mac:\n&gt; setwd(\"/Users/&lt;INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE&gt;/Documents/R_UKDS\")\nFor Linux:\n\ndir.create(\"~/Documents/R_UKDS\")\nsetwd(\"~/Documents/R_UKDS\")\n\nTyping getwd() confirms that the change has been recorded.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/home/mscsepw2/OneDrive/rguide/UKDS_RGuide\"\n\n\nNotes:\n\nAny character string that is neither a command or the name of an object (such as a variable name) needs to be put between inverted commas or quotation marks, otherwise it will be interpreted as the name of an object and R will return an error.\nsee the example below about loading user-created packages;\nEven when no parameters are specified for a command, brackets are compulsory as shown in the getwd() example above;\nR uses forward slashes rather than backslashes (unlike Windows applications, but like Linux) to separate directories. Using backlashes will return an error message;\nAlthough most R commands accept a large number of options to be specified. In many cases default values have been ‘factory set’ so that only the essential parameters need specifying.\n\nThe output of most R commands can be either directly displayed on the screen (as in the above example) or stored in objects that can be subsequently reused in further commands. This object-oriented feature separates R from traditional statistical software.\nFor instance, typing:\n\na&lt;-getwd()\n\nwill store the output of getwd() (that is, the name of the current default directory) into an object called ‘a’. In order to view the content of a, one can just type its name:\n\na\n\n[1] \"/home/mscsepw2/OneDrive/rguide/UKDS_RGuide\"\n\n\n\nWriting R scripts via R Studio\nMost users will want to write their code in a script file, similar to the ‘do’ file in Stata or syntax file in SPSS. R script files can be identified with their .R suffix. To open an existing R script in RStudio select File&gt;Open File then the relevant script file. To create a new script select File&gt;New File&gt;Open File (shortcut: Control+Shift+N) this will open a new script window in which to type commands.",

This can also be done with the pull-down menus of RStudio.\nFor example, to install the ‘foreign’ package one need to type:\ninstall.packages(\"foreign\",repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\nIf the address of the package repository is not specified via the repos= option, a pull-down menu will appear, asking for one. Choosing https://cloud.r-project.org will automatically select the closest mirror site. Packages installation only needs to be done once.\nOriginally, Foreign enabled users to import Stata (version 12 or older) or SPSS datasets. For Stata datasets saved under version 13 and above as well as more recent SPSS datasets, the haven package is required.\ninstall.packages(\"haven\",repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\nTo use a package already installed in the local R library, the library() command is needed:\n\nlibrary(haven)\n\nSimply typing:\n&gt; library()\nWill list all libraries installed on the computer that can be loaded in memory. This can be a rather long list!\n\nBesides a full archive of R packages, the CRAN website provides a series of manuals, including Writing R Extensions, which describes how users can write their own packages and submit them to CRAN.\nOnce a package is installed, it will be permanently stored in the local R library on the computer, unless deleted it with the remove.packages() command (not advised as this can break dependencies between packages!).\n&gt; remove.packages(\"name of the package\")\nPackages required for an analysis have to be loaded every time a new R session is started (But not every time a syntax file is run!).",

    "section": "2.6 Objects",
    "text": "2.6 Objects\nR is an object oriented language, which means that almost any information it uses is stored as ‘objects’ (i.e. containers) that can be manipulated independently. During an R session, multiple objects are available simultaneously (for instance datasets, but also summary tables or new variables produced from it). Typing:\n&gt; ls()\nwill list all the objects that are currently in memory.\nObjects belong to classes or types which have distinct properties. There are many classes of objects in R. By comparison, Stata has only macros, variables and scalars that are directly available to most users. Common object classes include:\n\nfactors: these are equivalent to categorical variables (see below);\nnumeric: numerical variables – whether continuous or ordinal;\ncharacter: alphanumeric variables;\nvectors: a list of items that are of the same type;\nlists: more complex list of objects, functions or datasets\ndata frames (datasets);\nmatrices, etc.\n\nSome operations are understandably only possible with certain types of objects.\nMore advanced users can also create their own object classes. Describing R objects and their properties is well beyond the purpose of this guide and users interested should consult the online documentation for further explanations.\nTo create or assign a value to an object, one uses the assignment operator (&lt;-). For example:\n\nx &lt;- 5  \n\nx\n\n[1] 5\n\nls()\n\n[1] \"a\" \"x\"\n\n\nIn this example we have assigned the value 5 to an object called x. If you type the letter x, the value ‘5’ will be returned in your console. The object x will appear in the R environment after the ls() command.\n\nDeleting objects\nThe rm() function can be used to remove objects from the environment (session). These objects can be variables, lists, datasets, etc. For instance, to remove the object ‘x’, or the fictitious dataset called ‘mydata’:\n\nrm(x)   \nls()\n\n[1] \"a\"\n\n\n&gt; rm(mydata)\n\n\n\n\n\nData frames\nAmong the various classes of objects one may use in R, a few are essential to understand when analysing survey data. Their characteristics are briefly listed below;\nData frames are objects that come closest to datasets in traditional statistical software or worksheets in Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. They are objects that have indexed rows and columns, both of which may have names. Data frames columns can be seen as variables and lines or rows as observations. Each cell in the data frame can be uniquely identified by its position. Data frames are typically the object in which survey datasets are stored.\nLet’s assume that we have a small data frame called ‘mydata’. Here are a few basic commands to examine it:\nDetermining the size of a data frame:\nthe dim() command returns the number of rows and columns of a data frame\n\ndim(mydata)\n\n[1] 50  6\n\n\nR tells us that our data is made of 50 rows and 6 columns, in other words of 50 observations and 6 variables. What if I want a quick overview of the dataset?\n\nhead(mydata)\n\n    RSex skipmeal                   Married\n1 Female       NA Married/living as married\n2 Female        1        Separated/divorced\n3 Female       NA Married/living as married\n4   Male       NA             Never married\n5   Male        1             Never married\n6   Male       NA Married/living as married\n        Poverty1                         HEdQual3\n1        Was not Higher educ below degree/A level\n2        Was not Higher educ below degree/A level\n3        Was not             O level or equiv/CSE\n4        Was not Higher educ below degree/A level\n5        Was not                 No qualification\n6 Was in poverty                             &lt;NA&gt;\n  NatFrEst\n1        5\n2       30\n3       50\n4       50\n5       50\n6       10\n\n\nThe head() command displays the first six lines of the dataset. Depending on the number of variables the output of head() can become quickly overwhelming, as the size of the lines on most screens is limited!\nObtaining the names of variables (or columns) in the dataset: This can be done using either ls() which we already have used, or the names() commands. ls() returns the variables names, sorted alphabetically, whereas names() returns them in their actual order in the data frame.\n\nls(mydata)\n\n[1] \"HEdQual3\" \"Married\"  \"NatFrEst\" \"Poverty1\"\n[5] \"RSex\"     \"skipmeal\"\n\nnames(mydata)\n\n[1] \"RSex\"     \"skipmeal\" \"Married\"  \"Poverty1\"\n[5] \"HEdQual3\" \"NatFrEst\"\n\n\nWe can see that in the data frame, the “RSex” column comes in fact before “Poverty1”.\nAccessing variables:\nColumns of a data frame, or variables, can be accessed by their name preceded by the $ sign:\n\nmydata$NatFrEst\n\n [1]  5 30 50 50 50 10  1 NA  5 50 60 25 30  3 25 10 80\n[18]  5 50 50 40 45  2 82 60 40 10 10 40 15 30 30  2 10\n[35] 75 99 70 50 10 30  1 10 85 45 70 25 40 30 10 25\nattr(,\"value.labels\")\nnamed numeric(0)\n\n\nLists all values of NatFrEst, as well as extra technical information at the bottom.\nAlternatively, columns/variables and rows can be identified numerically by their position in the data frame using square brackets:\ndataframe[row number,column number]\nGiven that RSex is the first column of our dataset\n\nmydata[,1]\n\n [1] Female Female Female Male   Male   Male   Male  \n [8] Female Male   Male   Male   Female Female Male  \n[15] Female Female Female Female Female Female Male  \n[22] Female Female Male   Male   Female Female Female\n[29] Female Male   Female Female Female Female Male  \n[36] Male   Female Female Male   Female Male   Male  \n[43] Female Male   Female Male   Female Female Female\n[50] Male  \nLevels: Male Female\n\n\nReturns the same output as previously. Not specifying a row or column name within the square brackets tells R to display them all.\n\nmydata[6,]\n\n  RSex skipmeal                   Married\n6 Male       NA Married/living as married\n        Poverty1 HEdQual3 NatFrEst\n6 Was in poverty     &lt;NA&gt;       10\n\n\nReturns the values of all the variables for the sixth row of the data frame. Specifying both a row and column number, will return a unique observation:\n\nmydata[6,6]\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nwhich in this case is 10. Finally, more than one column or row can be displayed by concatenating their number using the c() function:\n\nmydata[c(6,9),c(1,6)]\n\n  RSex NatFrEst\n6 Male       10\n9 Male        5\n\n\nThe above command returns respectively the sixth and 9th observations for the sixth column. Please note that columns names can also be used instead of their number, provided that they are put between inverted commas:\n\nmydata[c(6,9),c('RSex','NatFrEst')]\n\n  RSex NatFrEst\n6 Male       10\n9 Male        5\n\n\nReturns the same result as previously. Having a data frame to hand allows us to explore other types of objects commonly found in R. The type of a variable can be displayed by simply using the class() function.\n\n\nNumeric\nNumeric objects are simple numerical vectors (ie a single or a list of numbers). Here this is the case for NatFrEst, the estimated proportion of people making wrong benefits claims, according to respondents to the survey.\n\nclass(mydata$NatFrEst)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\n\nCharacter\nCharacter objects are alphanumeric vectors, that is variables which consist of text string(s).\n\nclass(mydata$Married)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nhead(mydata$Married) ### Let's look at the first five rows of Married\n\n[1] \"Married/living as married\"\n[2] \"Separated/divorced\"       \n[3] \"Married/living as married\"\n[4] \"Never married\"            \n[5] \"Never married\"            \n[6] \"Married/living as married\"\n\n\n\n\nFactors\nA distinctive feature of R is that categorical variables whether ordinal or polynomial are stored in objects known as factors. Factors should be thought of as a special type of variable with a discrete set of values, known as levels. Factors can be unordered or ordered. In our data, Rsex (Gender of the respondent) is such an object:\n\nclass(mydata$RSex)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\nThe main difference between factors and traditional categorical variables in Stata or SPSS is that they do not consist of arbitrary numerical values with which substantive value labels are associated.\nLet’s further examine this factor. It is always a good idea to check the ordering of factor levels in a newly created variable with the level() command\n{r 2.25} returns the levels (ie the values) of RSex. ‘Male’ is the first level of Rsex, and ‘Female’ the second one, irrespective of the values originally assigned and described in the codebook of the dataset. It is possible to change the ordering of factor levels with the factor() function.\n\nmydata$RSex&lt;-factor(mydata$RSex, # We re-use the existing factor levels from Rsex\n                    levels = levels(mydata$RSex)[c(2,1)]) # and reorder them\n\nThe above code tells R to create a new factor variable -RSex.New - whose levels are the same as the initial RSex, but with ‘Female’ (level number 2 in the original variable) coming first, and “Male” (level number 1) , second. The name of the new variable is arbitrary.\nWe can check the outcome:\n\nlevels(mydata$RSex)\n\n[1] \"Female\" \"Male\"  \n\n\nIn the next chapter an alternative approach to dealing with categorical variables imported from SPSS or Stata is presented.",

    "text": "3.5 Factor variables in the haven package\nAs we have seen in the previous chapter, statistical software such as SPSS or Stata treat categorical variables as numerical variables. Values labels are then ‘attached’, allocating a substantive meaning to these values. On the other hand, R records categorical variables in objects that are called factors. They may be ordered or not. Factors consist of limited number of integers to which correspond levels ie characters often describing them used when the factor is displayed. These numbers range from 1 to the number of categories or levels of the factor, and are thefore distinct from the values categorical variables are allocated in codebooks.\nUnfortunately, there aren’t straightforward ways to convert SPSS or Stata labelled categorical variables into R factors. The approach followed by haven package that we use here is preserve the numeric values of the original variables, and add attributes that contain the labels and can be manipulated separately. Attributes are a special type of R objects that have a name, and can be read using the attr() function. haven-converted categorical variables all have a ‘label’ and ‘labels’ attribute. The former is the variable description, the latter the value labels.\nThese haven-imported numeric variables can be converted into R factors with their levels consisting of the SPSS or Stata value labels, but whose numeric values will simply reflect their order in the vector of levels.\nLet’s examine the original variable description and value labels with the attr() function. We can do this variable by variable…\n\nattr(bsa$HEdQual3, \"label\")\n\n[1] \"Highest educational qual obtained - dv\"\n\n\nWe do the same with value labels:\n\nattr(bsa$HEdQual3, \"labels\")\n\n                          Degree Higher educ below degree/A level \n                               1                                2 \n            O level or equiv/CSE                 No qualification \n                               3                                4 \n                   DK/Refusal/NA \n                               8 \n\n\nThe value labels displayed above include both the text description and the original numeric value from SPSS/Stata.\nFinally, for easier data manipulation, these haven converted ‘labelled numeric variables’ can be converted into R factors using the as_factor() function. Factor levels in the converted variables can consist of either the value labels:\n\nlevels(as_factor(bsa$HEdQual3, levels=\"labels\"))\n\n[1] \"Degree\"                           \"Higher educ below degree/A level\"\n[3] \"O level or equiv/CSE\"             \"No qualification\"                \n[5] \"DK/Refusal/NA\"                   \n\n\n… or, as in the earlier output, of both the original SPSS/Stata numeric values and the value labels:\n\nlevels(as_factor(bsa$HEdQual3, levels=\"both\"))\n\n[1] \"[1] Degree\"                          \n[2] \"[2] Higher educ below degree/A level\"\n[3] \"[3] O level or equiv/CSE\"            \n[4] \"[4] No qualification\"                \n[5] \"[8] DK/Refusal/NA\"",

It is always advised to create new variables when recoding old ones so the original data is not tampered with.\n\nbsa$Married.f&lt;-as_factor(bsa$Married,\"labels\")\nbsa$Married2 &lt;- ifelse(bsa$Married.f==\"Married/living as married\",\"Partnered\",bsa$Married)\nbsa$Married2 &lt;- ifelse(bsa$Married.f==\"Widowed\" | \n                       bsa$Married.f==\"Never married\" | \n                      bsa$Married.f==\"Separated/divorced\",\"Not partnered\",bsa$Married2)\n\ntable(bsa$Married2)\n\n\nNot partnered     Partnered \n         1778          2209 \n\n\nThe second and fourth categories have been renamed to ‘Not partnered’.

Let’s decompose it:\n\ndplyr use the pipe symbol ie %&gt;% or |&gt; which enables to sequentially combine functions. We will come back to this later in this guide.\nmutate() is the generic variable creation/alteration command, and can handle complex combinations of conditions as well as multiple simultaneous variable creation operations.\ncase_when() is the function that allows recoding numerical, character, or factor variables. On the left hand side of the tilde ~ are the condition or the values that need to be matched in the original variable , and on the right hand side, the attributed ie recoded values in the new variable. Note that in this case, the recoded variable is by default a character object and needs to be converted into a factor for easier manipulation.\n\nExtra tips:\n\nAs with any data manipulation exercise, caution is required, and it is recommended to create new variables with the recoded value rather than alter an original variable when handling missing values.\nThe standard value attribution command in R is &lt;-. However, = will also work in many cases.\nUnless explicitly specified (in our case, by adding the bsa$ prefix to variable name), the objects created are not included in the data frame from which they were computed.",

    "section": "4.4 Missing Values",
    "text": "4.4 Missing Values\nExplicit missing values in R (ie values that R itself considers as missing) are represented as NA for factors and numerical variables. For character variables, missing values are simply empty strings, ie \"\". R has a series of functions specifically designed to handle NAs.\nR has fewer safety nets than other packages for handling missing values. Most function won’t issue warn users about whether or how many how many observations with missing values have been dropped. On the other hand, some commands will return error messages and won’t run when missing values are present. This is the case of mean() for example.\n\n4.4.1 Inspecting missing data\nThe logical function is.na() assesses each observation in variables and identifies whether cases are valid or missing. The result will appear as a boolean TRUE/FALSE vector for each observation. is.na() can be combined with other functions:\n\nWith table() in order to get the frequencies of missing values of a specific variable.\nWith sum() in order to count the number of missing observations of variables or whole datasets.\n\n\ntable(is.na(bsa$leftrigh))#of missing values in the leftright variable \n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n 3206   782 \n\nsum(is.na(bsa)) # of missing values in the whole dataset\n\n[1] 41487\n\nmean(is.na(bsa$leftrigh)) #returns the proportion of NAs...\n\n[1] 0.1960883\n\nmean(is.na(bsa)) # returns the proportion in the dataset\n\n[1] 0.3250925\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Recoding missing values as NA (continuous variables)\nIt may sometimes be useful to recode implicit missing values (ie considered by the data producer as missing, but not by R) of either numeric objects or factors into &lt;NA&gt;, in order to simplify case selection when conducting analyses. This can either be done with Base R code or the more advanced data manipulation functions from the dplyr package that we explored earlier.\nLet’s assume for a moment that we would like to get rid of respondents aged under 25 for our analysis. A safe way to proceed is by creating a new dataset.\n\nbsa$RAgeCat.f &lt;- as_factor(bsa$RAgeCat) # convert labelled numeric variable into factor\ntable(bsa$RAgeCat.f)                      \n\n\n     18-24      25-34      35-44      45-54      55-59      60-64        65+ \n       223        591        650        729        320        333       1138 \nDK/Refused \n         0 \n\nbsa.adults&lt;-bsa[!bsa$RAgeCat.f==\"18-24\", ] # retains all values except those that match the condiction  \ntable(bsa.adults$RAgeCat.f)                      \n\n\n     18-24      25-34      35-44      45-54      55-59      60-64        65+ \n         0        591        650        729        320        333       1138 \nDK/Refused \n         0 \n\n\nWhy is the number of missing values 227 and not 223 as the original number of respondents aged 18-24? Because there were already 3 missing values for the RAgeCat variable.\nWe can also notice that although there are now no observation left in the 18-24 category, it is still displayed by table(). This is because levels are attributes of factors and are not deleted with observations. We can remove unused levels permanently with droplevels()\n\nbsa$RAgeCat.f&lt;-droplevels(bsa$RAgeCat.f)\ntable(bsa$RAgeCat.f)\n\n\n18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64   65+ \n  223   591   650   729   320   333  1138 \n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Working with missing values\nExplicit missing values (coded as NA) can be taken care of by R’s own missing values functions. For instance using the na.rm=T or na.rm=TRUE option will remove missing values from an analysis (typing ?na.rm will provide more information). Below is a summary of how NAs are dealt with by common R commands:\n\n\n\nTreatment of missing values by R commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDefault action\nParameter\n\n\n\n\nmean(), sd(),median()\nIncludes NA (may return an error)\nna.rm=T\n\n\ncor(),cov()\nIncludes NA (may return an error)\nuse=“complete.obs”\n\n\ntable()\nExcludes NA\nuseNA = “always” to display NAs\n\n\nxtabs()\nExcludes NA\naddNA = T to display NAs\n\n\nlm(),glm()\nExcludes NA\nna.action=NULL",

Suppose we would like to examine the interest for politics among people aged 18-24.\nWe can either create an adhoc data frame:\n\ntable(bsa$Politics)\n\n\n   1    2    3    4    5 \n 739  982 1179  708  379 \n\nbsa.young&lt;-bsa[bsa$RAgeCat.f==\"18-24\",]  \ntable(bsa.young$Politics)\n\n\n 1  2  3  4  5 \n29 41 72 56 25 \n\n\nOr we can directly limit the extent of the analysis on the go:\n\n  table(bsa$Politics[bsa$RAgeCat.f==\"18-24\"])\n\n\n 1  2  3  4  5 \n29 41 72 56 25 \n\n\nIn the first example it was necessary to include a comma after specg the condition. This is meant to indicate that we want to retain all variables ie columns in the dataset. The comma is not necessary in the second example as we are already working with a single variable.\nUsing dplyr*\nNow suppose we want to further restrict the analysis to people identifying as Males. We could use the same Base R syntax as above, but with more than one condition coding tends to become a bit cumbersome. We could instead use the more convenient syntax from the dplyr package. Either:\n\nbsa.young.males&lt;-bsa%&gt;%\n  filter(RAgeCat.f==\"18-24\" & as_factor(Rsex)==\"Male\")  \n\ntable(as_factor(bsa.young.males$Politics))\n\n\nItem not applicable   ... a great deal,        quite a lot,               some, \n                  0                  15                  22                  30 \n     not very much,    or, none at all?          Don`t know             Refusal \n                 18                   9                   0                   0 \n\n\nOr. as before embed it as a condition within table() :\n\n  table(\n         as_factor(\n          bsa%&gt;%\n          filter(RAgeCat.f==\"18-24\" & as_factor(Rsex)==\"Male\")%&gt;%\n          select(Politics)\n  )\n  )\n\nPolitics\nItem not applicable   ... a great deal,        quite a lot,               some, \n                  0                  15                  22                  30 \n     not very much,    or, none at all?          Don`t know             Refusal \n                 18                   9                   0                   0 \n\n\nFilter() and select() are the functions that specify respectively rows and columns to be kept/removed. They can be combined or used independently and used in any order.\nWe are now equipped with the necessary information to move to the next stage and carry out basic analysis using R.",

    "text": "5.3 Categorical Variables\nAs with continuous variables, R offers several tools that can be used to describe the distribution of categorical variables. One- and two-way contingency tables are the most commonly used.\n\n5.3.1 One way frequency tables\nThere are several R commands that we can use to create frequency tables. The most common ones table(),xtabs() or ftable() which return the frequencies of observations within each level of a factor. For example, in order to obtain the political affiliation of BSA respondents in 2017:\n\ntable(as_factor(bsa$PartyId2))\n\n\n     Not applicable        Conservative              Labour    Liberal Democrat \n                  0                1263                1479                 241 \n        Other party                None         Green Party Other answer/DK/Ref \n                193                 515                  79                   0 \n\n\nAs with any other R functions, the outcome of table() can be stored as an object for further processing:\n\na&lt;-table(as_factor(bsa$PartyId2))\n\ntable() does not compute proportions or percentages. Proportions are obtained using the prop.table() function which in turn does not produce percentages. It is also a good idea to round the results for greater readability. Either:\n\nround(\n  100*\n    prop.table(a),\n  1) \n\n\n     Not applicable        Conservative              Labour    Liberal Democrat \n                0.0                33.5                39.2                 6.4 \n        Other party                None         Green Party Other answer/DK/Ref \n                5.1                13.7                 2.1                 0.0 \n\n\n… or:\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(\n          table(as_factor(bsa$PartyId2))\n        ),\n      1)\n\n\n     Not applicable        Conservative              Labour    Liberal Democrat \n                0.0                33.5                39.2                 6.4 \n        Other party                None         Green Party Other answer/DK/Ref \n                5.1                13.7                 2.1                 0.0 \n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Two way or more contingency table\nThe simplest way to produce a two-way contingency table is to pass another variable to table():\n\ntable(as_factor(bsa$PartyId2), as_factor(bsa$Rsex))\n\n                     \n                      skipped or na Male Female Dontknow Refusal\n  Not applicable                  0    0      0        0       0\n  Conservative                    0  627    636        0       0\n  Labour                          0  644    835        0       0\n  Liberal Democrat                0  124    117        0       0\n  Other party                     0   97     96        0       0\n  None                            0  199    316        0       0\n  Green Party                     0   31     48        0       0\n  Other answer/DK/Ref             0    0      0        0       0\n\n\nHowever, when dealing with more than one variable it is recommended to use xtabs() instead as it has a number of desirable functions directly available as options. The syntax is slightly different as it relies on a formula ie a R object consisting of elements separated by a tilde ‘~’. The variables to be tabulated are specified on the right hand side of the formula. In order to lighten the syntax, we will also recode PartyId2 and Rsex permanently into factors.\n\nbsa$PartyId2.f&lt;-as_factor(bsa$PartyId2)\nbsa$Rsex.f&lt;-as_factor(bsa$Rsex)\n\nxtabs(~PartyId2.f +Rsex.f,\n      data = bsa)\n\n                     Rsex.f\nPartyId2.f            skipped or na Male Female Dontknow Refusal\n  Not applicable                  0    0      0        0       0\n  Conservative                    0  627    636        0       0\n  Labour                          0  644    835        0       0\n  Liberal Democrat                0  124    117        0       0\n  Other party                     0   97     96        0       0\n  None                            0  199    316        0       0\n  Green Party                     0   31     48        0       0\n  Other answer/DK/Ref             0    0      0        0       0\n\n\nThe data= parameter does not have to be explicitly specified as simply using ´bsa’ will work. Other useful options are:\n\nsubset=, which allows direct specification of a subpopulation from which to derive the table;\ndrop.unused.levels=T to remove empty levels (categories with zero observations) from being displayed;\nweights~ variables on the right hand side of the formula will be treated as weights, a useful feature for survey analysis.\n\nAs previously prop.table() is necessary in order to obtain proportions:\n\nb&lt;-xtabs(~PartyId2.f +Rsex.f,\n         bsa,\n         drop.unused.levels = T)\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(b),\n      1) ### Cell percentages\n\n                  Rsex.f\nPartyId2.f         Male Female\n  Conservative     16.6   16.9\n  Labour           17.1   22.1\n  Liberal Democrat  3.3    3.1\n  Other party       2.6    2.5\n  None              5.3    8.4\n  Green Party       0.8    1.3\n\n\nThe largest group in the sample (22.1%) is made of labour-voting females, the smallest of green-voting males.\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(b,1),\n      1) ### Option 1 for row percentages\n\n                  Rsex.f\nPartyId2.f         Male Female\n  Conservative     49.6   50.4\n  Labour           43.5   56.5\n  Liberal Democrat 51.5   48.5\n  Other party      50.3   49.7\n  None             38.6   61.4\n  Green Party      39.2   60.8\n\n\nConservative voters are more or less evenly split between men and women, whereas Labour and Green voters are more likely to be women.\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(b,2),\n      1) ### Option 2 for column percentages\n\n                  Rsex.f\nPartyId2.f         Male Female\n  Conservative     36.4   31.1\n  Labour           37.4   40.8\n  Liberal Democrat  7.2    5.7\n  Other party       5.6    4.7\n  None             11.6   15.4\n  Green Party       1.8    2.3\n\n\nSimilar proportions of men voted Conservative and Labour (36-37%), whereas women were clearly more likely to vote Labour.\nThere is not a straightforward way to obtain percentages in three-way contingency tables with either xtabs() or table().

Please not that we have used the droplevels() function when spcecifying the BSA data frame within ftble().

We demonstrate below the most straightforward one, which is obtained by using some of the functions available in the dplyr package.\n\nbsa%&gt;%\n  group_by(PartyId2.f)%&gt;%\n  summarise(mdscore=median(libauth,na.rm=T),\n            sdscore=sd(libauth,na.rm=T))\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 3\n  PartyId2.f       mdscore sdscore\n  &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Conservative        3.67   0.587\n2 Labour              3.33   0.774\n3 Liberal Democrat    3.17   0.726\n4 Other party         3.67   0.739\n5 None                3.67   0.584\n6 Green Party         2.83   0.872\n7 &lt;NA&gt;                3.67   0.564\n\n\nThe above command produces a table of summary values (median and standard deviations) of the Liberal vs authoritarian scale. We can see from the first one that Green party voters are the most liberal, followed by Labour, whereas non voters and Conservatives are the most authoritarian. Liberal Democrats are the most cohesive group (ie with the smallest standard deviation). We chose to leave nonresponses for PartyId2 for this analysis. Some users might want to remove them instead before computing their results as in the table below. We do this by using is.na(), which checks variables for the presence of system missing values, in conjunction with filter().\n\nbsa%&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(PartyId2.f)) %&gt;%                              \n  group_by(Rsex.f,PartyId2.f) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mnscore=sd(libauth,na.rm=T),\n            mdscore=median(libauth,na.rm=T))\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n# Groups:   Rsex.f [2]\n   Rsex.f PartyId2.f       mnscore mdscore\n   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Male   Conservative       0.607    3.67\n 2 Male   Labour             0.765    3.33\n 3 Male   Liberal Democrat   0.766    3.17\n 4 Male   Other party        0.703    3.83\n 5 Male   None               0.616    3.67\n 6 Male   Green Party        1.04     2.67\n 7 Female Conservative       0.565    3.67\n 8 Female Labour             0.781    3.33\n 9 Female Liberal Democrat   0.688    3.17\n10 Female Other party        0.773    3.67\n11 Female None               0.565    3.67\n12 Female Green Party        0.744    3   \n\n\nWhen further broken down by gender, we can see that overall the same trends remain valid, with some nuances: male Green supporters are markedly more liberal than their female counterpart, the opposite being true among Conservative supporters.\nInstead of tables of summary statistics, we may want to have summary statistics computed as variables that will be added to the current dataset for each corresponding gender/political affiliation group. This is straightforward to do with dplyr, we just need to use the mutate() command.\n\nbsa&lt;-bsa%&gt;%\n  group_by(Rsex.f,PartyId2.f)%&gt;%\n  mutate(msscore=sd(libauth,na.rm=T),\n         mdscore=median(libauth,na.rm=T))\n\nHowever, we also need to add the newly created variables into the existing bsa dataset, which the first line of the syntax above does. We can check that the variables have been created and that the correct values have been allocated to each sex/affiliation category.\n\nnames(bsa)\n\n [1] \"Sserial\"          \"Rsex\"             \"RAgeCat\"          \"Married\"         \n [5] \"ChildHh\"          \"HEdQual3\"         \"eq_inc_quintiles\" \"RClassGp\"        \n [9] \"CCBELIEV\"         \"carallow\"         \"carreduc\"         \"carnod2\"         \n[13] \"cartaxhi\"         \"carenvdc\"         \"plnenvt\"          \"plnuppri\"        \n[17] \"Politics\"         \"Voted\"            \"actchar\"          \"actpol\"          \n[21] \"govnosa2\"         \"PartyId2\"         \"leftrigh\"         \"libauth\"         \n[25] \"WtFactor\"         \"PartyId2.f\"       \"Rsex.f\"           \"RAgeCat.f\"       \n[29] \"msscore\"          \"mdscore\"         \n\nbsa[4:8,c(\"Rsex\",\"PartyId2\",\"mdscore\")]\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  Rsex       PartyId2              mdscore\n  &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;  &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2 [Female]  2 [Labour]              3.33\n2 1 [Male]    3 [Liberal Democrat]    3.17\n3 2 [Female] NA                       3.67\n4 1 [Male]    3 [Liberal Democrat]    3.17\n5 2 [Female]  6 [Green Party]         3",

    "text": "6.3 Inference using survey procedures\nThe weighting procedures described above could be described as ‘quick and dirty’ in that they compute representative point estimates – ie a single value. Computing the precision of survey data estimates – for example via their standard error – requires more than just adding weights to a command. Information about the survey design, its primary sampling units, strata and clusters is required so that robust standard errors, statistical tests and/or confidence interval can be computed. The Survey package was designed in order to deal with this set of issues. It provides functions for integrating survey design into R as well as computing common estimates. Its most important features are described below.\nIn order to use survey fonctions one first needs to create a svydesign object, in essence a version of the data that incorporates the sample design information available, then compute the required estimate using the svydesign object.\nAn common issue with survey datasets available in the UK is that sampling information is often only available in secured version of the data, restricting its access to authorised users in a secure lab. Although it is sometimes possible to use available variables to account for aspects of the sample design – region as a strata in the case of stratified samples – in most cases users are left with computing standard errors without sample design information, which amounts to assuming that the sample was drawn purely at random. Even if this is the case however, using the survey package is recommended, as it provides a coherent framework for computing survey parameters.\n\nlibrary(survey) ### Loading the package in memory\nbsa.design&lt;-svydesign(ids =~1,\n                      weights=~WtFactor,\n                      data=bsa) \n\nThe code above simply declares the survey design by creating the bsa.design object (the name is arbitrary). The ids= parameter is where primary sampling units are declared, as well as any clustering information as a formula ie ~PSU+cluster2id.... When PSU information is unavailable ids is given the value 1 or 0. A strata= and fpc= are available in order to declare the sampling strata and the variable used for finite population correction. None of these are available in the bsa dataset, and estimation commands will therefore rely on the assumption of simple random sampling.\nWe can now compute estimates similar estimates as in the previous sections. The code below provides the mean of the left vs right political orientation indicator, as well as its 95% confidence interval:\n\na&lt;-svymean(~leftrigh,\n        bsa.design,\n        na.rm = T)### Computes the mean and its standard error...\n\na\n\n           mean     SE\nleftrigh 2.5216 0.0155\n\nconfint(a) ### ... and confidence interval\n\n            2.5 %   97.5 %\nleftrigh 2.491277 2.551902\n\n\nAnd now for the median:\n\nsvyquantile(~leftrigh,\n            bsa.design,\n            quantiles=.5,\n            na.rm = T)\n\nError in (function (cond) : error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 't': Can't merge the outer name `ci` with a vector of length &gt; 1.\nPlease supply a `.name_spec` specification.\n\n\nFrequency and contingency tables are computed using svytable(), whose syntax relies on formulas similarly to xtabs() in the previous chapter.\n\n### A frequency table...\nround(100*\n        prop.table(\n          svytable(~RAgeCat.f,bsa.design)\n        ),\n      1)\n\nRAgeCat.f\n18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64   65+ \n 11.2  17.2  16.1  17.9   7.9   6.8  22.8 \n\n### And a two-way contingency table:\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(\n          svytable(~RAgeCat.f+Rsex.f,bsa.design),\n          1),\n      1)\n\n         Rsex.f\nRAgeCat.f Male Female\n    18-24 51.1   48.9\n    25-34 50.2   49.8\n    35-44 49.7   50.3\n    45-54 49.3   50.7\n    55-59 48.8   51.2\n    60-64 49.0   51.0\n    65+   45.4   54.6",

A few examples are provided below.\n\nMosaic plot\nMosaic plots provide a visualisation tool for two-way or more contingency tables. The surface of each rectangle, or bar represents the number of observations of the corresponding cells in the contingency table; whereas their length map the relative frequency of the second variable for each category of the first one equivalent to column percentages in a contingency table.

This is a three-way contingency table, that we can obtain with ftable() as shown in Section 5.2, combined with prop.table() for the computation of proportions and round(). As they are more straightforward to handle in ggplot, we convert the table object created by ftable into a data frame. Although we can specify titles and axis labels in the plotting command, it is preferable to keep things simple here and have them already in the the data.\nRather than using the full range of educational achievements recorded in HEdQual3, we would like instead to have a dichotomic variable between degree holders and non degree holders. Adding it directly in the ftable command as a boolean expression return a dichotomic variable: “TRUE” for Degree educated respondents, and “FALSE” for everyone else. We just need to change the levels of this factor variable to make them more intelligible. Finally we change the variable names in our data frame.\n\nbsa$HEdQual3.f&lt;-droplevels(as_factor(bsa$HEdQual3))\npa&lt;-round(100*\n            prop.table(\n              ftable(bsa$PartyId2.f,bsa$Rsex.f,(bsa$HEdQual3.f==\"Degree\")\n                     ),\n              1),\n          1)\n\npa&lt;-data.frame(pa)\nlevels(pa$Var3)&lt;-c(\"Below\",\"Degree\")\nnames(pa)&lt;-c(\"Affiliation\",\"Gender\",\"Education\",\"Percent\")\npa\n\n   Affiliation Gender Education Percent\n1          Con   Male     Below    72.7\n2          Lab   Male     Below    70.1\n3     Lib Dems   Male     Below    50.0\n4        Other   Male     Below    86.5\n5         None   Male     Below    88.8\n6       Greens   Male     Below    43.3\n7          Con Female     Below    82.6\n8          Lab Female     Below    67.3\n9     Lib Dems Female     Below    54.4\n10       Other Female     Below    74.7\n11        None Female     Below    83.9\n12      Greens Female     Below    48.9\n13         Con   Male    Degree    27.3\n14         Lab   Male    Degree    29.9\n15    Lib Dems   Male    Degree    50.0\n16       Other   Male    Degree    13.5\n17        None   Male    Degree    11.2\n18      Greens   Male    Degree    56.7\n19         Con Female    Degree    17.4\n20         Lab Female    Degree    32.7\n21    Lib Dems Female    Degree    45.6\n22       Other Female    Degree    25.3\n23        None Female    Degree    16.1\n24      Greens Female    Degree    51.1\n\n\nWe are now ready to plot the data. the ggplot() commands usually works as a succession of layers or options that are added to an initial plot specifications. Each extra layer is added after a + sign. In the example below, we specify the data and the aesthetic (ie the main parameters of the plot) with the first command: the x and y variables , and the first grouping variable, education). geom_bar() stipulates the bar plot, with the ṕosition=“dodge” for the bars to be located side by side (position=“stack”would have them on top of each other). Finally, facet_wrap() splits the plot by gender.\n\nggplot(data=pa,aes(y=Percent,x=Affiliation,fill=Education))+\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  theme_minimal()+                  ### Theme for visualisation\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#702082\", \"#008755\"))+ ### Custom colours (optional)\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")",

    "text": "8.1 Differences between means\nTwo common ways of conducting statistical testing with means in samples consist in testing whether they are significantly different from 0 (one sample t-test), or whether they differ between two groups (two samples t test). In the latter case, one can further distinguish between independent samples (where means come from different groups), or paired samples (when the same measure is taken at several point in time). Given that it is probably one of the most widely used statistical tests in social sciences, we will only cover the former here. Several R packages provide functions for conducting t tests. We will be using t.test(), provided by the stats package (R Base).\nSuppose we would like to test whether the libertarianism vs authoritarianism score libauth significantly differs between men and women using a t test. A two sided test is the default, with H_0 or the null hypothesis being that there is no differences between groups, and H_1 or the alternative hypotheis that the group means do indeed differ. The test is specified with a formula with on the left hand side the quantity to be tested and on the right hand side the grouping variable.\nOne sided tests can be conducted by specifying that the alternative hypothesis (H_1) is either greater or less. t.test() assumes that by default the variances are unequal. This can be changed with the var.equal=T option.\n# Testing for significant differences in liberal vs authoritarian score\nt.test(libauth~Rsex.f,\n       data=bsa)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  libauth by Rsex.f\nt = 1.1622, df = 3011.9, p-value = 0.2452\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.02035161  0.07959393\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group Male mean in group Female \n            3.527793             3.498172\nNo significant differences (ie the difference in libauth between men and women is not significantly different from zero)\n# Testing for whether men have a lower (ie more left-wing)  score\nt.test(leftrigh~Rsex.f,\n       data=bsa, \n       alternative=\"less\")      \n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  leftrigh by Rsex.f\nt = -2.0687, df = 2858, p-value = 0.01933\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is less than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n        -Inf -0.01197607\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group Male mean in group Female \n            2.487564             2.546087\nMen have a significantly lower score on the scale (at the .05 threshold) and are therefore on average leaning more to the left than women.\nThe result of the above tests may be biased as they do not account for bias from eithersample design or non response. When results representative of the British population are required, a survey designed informed version of the t test should be used. The survey package that we used earlier in Chapter 6 includes such a function.\nlibrary(survey)\nbsa.design&lt;-svydesign(ids =~1,           # Declaring the survey design\n                      weights=~WtFactor,\n                      data=bsa) \n\nsvyttest(libauth~Rsex.f,bsa.design)   # SD informed t-test of libauth by gender\n\n\n    Design-based t-test\n\ndata:  libauth ~ Rsex.f\nt = 0.10069, df = 3211, p-value = 0.9198\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.05411275  0.05997165\nsample estimates:\ndifference in mean \n       0.002929454 \n\nsvyttest(leftrigh~Rsex.f,bsa.design) # SD informed t-test of leftrigh by gender\n\n\n    Design-based t-test\n\ndata:  leftrigh ~ Rsex.f\nt = 2.308, df = 3204, p-value = 0.02106\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.01085242 0.13337485\nsample estimates:\ndifference in mean \n        0.07211364\nIn this case the output of svyttest() does not lead to different conclusion than those we drew above. We can however notice that the significance of differences in political affiliation has decreased.",

This is usually achieved by testing whether the ratio of the variance between the two groups is significantly different from zero.

It consists in examining whether the association between two variables is likely to be due to chance or not, in other words whether the variability observed in a contingency table is significantly different from what would be expected were it due to chance.\nWe will be using chisq.test(), also from the stats package. By contrast with the test of correlation, the chisq.test() needs to be applied to contingency tables that have already been computed. Let us go back to an earlier example, and attempt to test whether the gender differences in political affiliations are due to chance or not.\n\nchisq.test(xtabs(~PartyId2.f +Rsex.f,bsa))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  xtabs(~PartyId2.f + Rsex.f, bsa)\nX-squared = 27.191, df = 5, p-value = 5.236e-05\n\n\nAs the R output shows, there are highly significant gender differences in political affiliations (p&lt;.001).\nDoes this remain true if we account for the survey design, as we did above for the t test? The survey package also has a survey design version of the chi square test:\n\nsvychisq(~PartyId2.f +Rsex.f, # We directly specify the contingency table here\n         bsa.design,        \n          statistic = \"Chisq\" # And we specify the kind of test we would like\n         )\n\n\n    Pearson's X^2: Rao & Scott adjustment\n\ndata:  svychisq(~PartyId2.f + Rsex.f, bsa.design, statistic = \"Chisq\")\nX-squared = 12.069, df = 5, p-value = 0.1126\n\n\nInterestingly this time, when accounting for survey design, sampling and non response, gender differences in political affiliations are not significant anymore.",

Let’s first briefly explore the variables using the class() and table() commands from the previous chapters:\n\nclass(bsa$Voted)\n\n[1] \"haven_labelled\" \"vctrs_vctr\"     \"double\"        \n\ntable(bsa$Voted)\n\n\n   1    2 \n2205  776 \n\n\nand\n\nclass(bsa$HEdQual3.f)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\ntable(bsa$HEdQual3.f)\n\n\n                          Degree Higher educ below degree/A level \n                            1050                             1086 \n            O level or equiv/CSE                 No qualification \n                            1026                              747 \n\n\nIt is a good idea to make sure that categorical variables are stored as factors. This is not absolutely necessary, but gives greater flexibility, for instance when having to change the reference category on the go.\nFor greater readability we can also shorten the levels of HEdQual3.f using the level() function:\n\nlevels(bsa$HEdQual3.f) ### The original level names  are a bit verbose...\n\n[1] \"Degree\"                           \"Higher educ below degree/A level\"\n[3] \"O level or equiv/CSE\"             \"No qualification\"                \n\n### ... Fortunately we can shorten them easily\nlevels(bsa$HEdQual3.f) &lt;- c(\"Degree\",\"A level and above\",\"GCSE or equiv\",\"No Qual\")\n\ntable(bsa$HEdQual3.f)\n\n\n           Degree A level and above     GCSE or equiv           No Qual \n             1050              1086              1026               747 \n\n\nWhat about the levels for our dependent variable? By default, the first level of a factor will be used as the reference category. This can be also checked with the contrasts(). In this case, 1 is associated with ‘No’, so the model will be predicting the probability of NOT voting. If the 1 was associated with ‘Yes’ then the model will be predicting the probability of voting.\n\nbsa$Voted.f&lt;-droplevels(as_factor(bsa$Voted)) # As before, factor conversion\nlevels(bsa$Voted.f) # Note that Yes comes before No\n\n[1] \"Yes\" \"No\" \n\ncontrasts(bsa$Voted.f)\n\n    No\nYes  0\nNo   1\n\n\nAs we are interested in the latter we need to change the reference category using the relevel() function. We can also create a new variable named Voted2 so as to keep a copy of the original variable intact.\n\n# Reverse the order\nbsa$Voted2 &lt;- relevel(bsa$Voted.f, ref = \"No\")\n\n#Check the contrasts\ncontrasts(bsa$Voted2)\n\n    Yes\nNo    0\nYes   1\n\n\nSince the outcome variable (Voted or Voted2) has a binomial distribution, we need to specify to the glm() function that we will be fitting a logistic regression model. We will do this by setting the argument ‘family’ to ‘binomial’ and the link function to ‘logit’. We could also have used ‘probit’ instead as a link function.

Please refer to the package documentation for more detailed explanations.\nRaw logistic regression coefficients measure the effect of variables on the probability of the outcome such as log(betaX)=P(y). It is common practice to convert these into odd ratios by exponentiating them, such as that betaX=exp(P(y)). The following code does this in R:\n\ncbind(\n  exp(coef(fit2)),exp(confint(fit2))\n) \n\n                                          2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept)                 3.0419750 2.0618311  4.5276614\nHEdQual3.fA level and above 0.6792550 0.5237628  0.8795335\nHEdQual3.fGCSE or equiv     0.3714919 0.2868078  0.4796010\nHEdQual3.fNo Qual           0.1486366 0.1089442  0.2015607\nRsex.fFemale                0.8546343 0.7130680  1.0235515\nRAgeCat.f25-34              0.7818917 0.5300310  1.1469983\nRAgeCat.f35-44              1.2295882 0.8316608  1.8095457\nRAgeCat.f45-54              2.3557310 1.5886305  3.4827615\nRAgeCat.f55-59              2.3178122 1.4718049  3.6621685\nRAgeCat.f60-64              4.9667132 3.0428167  8.2090111\nRAgeCat.f65+                8.7065916 5.7183039 13.2696921\n\n\nUsing the coef() and confint() functions, the code above respectively extracts the coefficients and associated 95% confidence intervals from fit2 then collate them using cbind().\n** Plotting the coefficients ** –&gt; We can visualise the odd ratios and their confidence intervals using the plot.model() function from the ‘sjPlot’ package.

It is used to compare the improvement in how several models fit some data relative to each other, allowing for the different number of parameters or degrees of freedom. The smaller the AIC, the better the fit. In order for the comparison to be valid, we need to ensure that the models were run with the same number of observations each time. As it is likely that the second model was run on a smaller sample, due to missing values for the Age and Sex variables, we will need to re-run the first one without.\n\nfit1 &lt;- glm(Voted2 ~ HEdQual3.f, data=bsa%&gt;%\n              filter(!is.na(Rsex.f) & !is.na(RAgeCat.f)), family=binomial(link=logit))\n\nc(fit1$aic,fit2$aic)\n\n[1] 3244.507 2944.535\n\n\nWe can see that the model controlling for gender and sex is a better fit to the data than the one without controls as it has an AIC of 2944.5 against 3244.5 for fit1.\nWith the information about the deviance from fit1 and fit2, we can also compute the overall significance of the model, that is whether the difference between the deviance (another likelihood-based measure of fit) for the fitted model is significantly different from that of the empty or null model. This is usually carried by conducting a chi square test, accounting for the differences in the number of parameters (ie degrees of freedom) between the two models. As with other R code, this can achieved step by step or in one go:\n\ndev.d&lt;-fit2$null.deviance - fit2$deviance \ndf.d&lt;-fit2$df.null - fit2$df.residual\np&lt;-1 - pchisq(dev.d, df.d)\nc(dev.d,df.d,p)\n\n[1] 370.5486  10.0000   0.0000\n\n\nThe Chi square test indicates that the difference in deviance of 370.5 with 10 degrees of freedom is highly significant (P&lt;.001)",
