    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide provides an introduction to analysing large scale social survey dataset using R with examples from the British Social Attitudes Survey 2020. It is aimed at two categories of users: \n\nThose outside higher education, or who do not have access to one commonly used commercial statistical software such as Stata, SPSS or SAS but who would like to conduct their own analysis beyond what is usually published by data producers such as the Office for National Statistics (for example statistics for specific groups of the population). This guide provides this group of users with a range of procedures that will help them produce straightforward and robust analyses tailored to their needs without spending unnecessary time on learning the inner workings of R. \nMore advanced users who are already familiar with other data analysis tools but who would like to learn how to carry out their analyses in R. The guide therefore focuses on providing succinct examples of common operations that most users carry out in the course of their research, including how to:\n\nread in and open datasets.\ndo common data manipulation operations.\nproduce simple descriptive statistics or tabulations.\nuse survey weights."

    "section": "",
    "text": "R is a free, user developed, object-oriented statistical programming language that originates in the ‘S’ and ‘S Plus’ languages developed during the 1970s and 1980s. It has a large audience in the science and statistics communities and is increasingly used in the social sciences for teaching and research purposes.\nAnyone can install and use R without charge, and to some extent contribute to and amend the existing program itself. R can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. Installation instructions as well as guides, tutorials and FAQ are available on the CRAN website.\nR is particularly favoured by users who want to develop their own statistical functions or implement technical advances that are not yet available in commercial packages. The existence of a vast number of user written packages (17,672 at the time of writing this guide) is one of the great strengths of R. Users who want to contribute should be aware that in order to be part of the R archive, a minimum set of rules need nonetheless to be followed.\nAlthough R can perform most of the analyses available in generalist software such as Stata, SPSS, or SAS, it has a broader potential since it can also be used for mapping, data mining or machine learning. Being a language also means that there are often several ways to carry out analyses in R, each one with its advantages and inconvenient. Users can also easily produce publication quality output from R thanks to its integration with the Markdown LaTeX document presentation system, and R graphs can also be imported into MS Word or LibreOffice documents.\nBy contrast with other statistical software, the R interface is rather minimal and consist merely of a terminal. In line with programming languages such a Python or C, R users tend to access it via an interface, or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This guide uses the R Studio development environment, one of the most common IDE for R. The data used in this guide is the British Social Attitudes Survey, 2017, Environment and Politics: Open Access Teaching Dataset, which can be downloaded from the UK Data Service website without registration. The website also has instructions on how to acquire and download large-scale survey datasets. Links and further information about the other training resources available online are provided at the end of this document.\n\nAlthough R has advantages over other statistical analysis software, it also has a few downsides, both of which are summarised below. Users should be reminded that as open-source software, R and its packages are developed by volunteers, which makes it a very flexible and dynamic project, but at the same time reliant on developers’ free time and goodwill.\n\n\n\nAdvantages and inconvenients of R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nR is free and allows users to perform almost any analysis they want.\nThe learning curve may be steep for users who do not have a prior background in statistics or programming.\n\n\nR puts statistical analysis closer to the reach of individual citizens rather than specialists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency of use and programming of the software and its routines, which improves the peer-reviewing and quality control of the software in many cases.\n\n\n\nVery flexible.\nProblem solving (for both advanced users and beginners) may be time-consuming, depending on how common the problem encountered, and may lead to more time spent solving technical rather than substantive issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailability of a wide range of advanced techniques not provided in other statistical software\nMany people who design R packages are, or will become busy academics. Packages can stop being maintained without notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very large user base provides abundant documentation, tutorials, and web pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several (sometimes many) ways of achieving a particular result in R. This can be confusing for novice researchers, but at the same time will allow users to tightly adjust their programmes to their needs."

    "text": "2.1 Download and installation\nR can be downloaded for free from the CRAN website and run like any other Windows application. Versions for Mac and Linux are also available. After installation, the standard and rather minimalist R interface that appears when the programme is launched is shown below.\n\n library(foreign) \n\n\n\n\nThe standard R interface\n\n\nThis interface merely allows the user to type in commands one by one in the console, and to install packages via pull-down menus. However, this basic installation, although fully functional, is rather minimal, not very ergonomic or user friendly. As with other statistical software, the primary way of interacting with R for most is to write programs, even basic ones in a syntax file (also called script file) that is saved and run whenever needed, which is not directly feasible with the standard R GUI.\nIt is therefore highly recommended to use R via an Integrated Development Environment (ie a more sophisticated user interface) such as RStudio for beginners to intermediate users or the StatEt module for Eclipse for more advanced programmers. Both are free, available for Windows, MacOS and Linux and offer users a large number of additional functionalities, such as syntax highlighting, integration with Github. Given that it probably has the largest number of users RStudio will be used to demonstrate examplkes of R syntax in the remainder of this document. In order for this guide to remain as universal as possible, we will not rely on the advanced features of RStudio, instead using it merely as an interface to the R engine."

The site will automatically generate a link to the version most compatible with the computer used to access it. Once downloaded double click on the file and follow the installation instructions.\nBy default, the R Studio interface consists of four main panels, respectively known as the script editor (top left panel), the console (bottom left panel), the Environment (top right panel) and the File/Directory/Help (bottom right panel).\n\n\n\nThe R Studio default interface\n\n\nAs such a complex interface can be visually overwhelming for some users and is not required for the purpose of this guide, we will minimise the Global Environment and Files/Directory/Help panels by clicking in the center of the window and dragging right to the edge of the screen. This way, only the script and console panels remain visible. The tiling of the panels can be customised in Tools&gt;Global Options&gt;Pane Layout.

    "section": "2.3 Interacting with R",
    "text": "2.3 Interacting with R\nAs already mentioned, one can type R commands directly in the console of RStudio and/or by typing sequences of commands in a script file.\nMost R commands adopt the following syntax: \n&gt; command(parameter1, parameter2, ...) \nAll R commands are followed by brackets, even if there are no parameters.\nIn the following example we are going to set up the default working directory, that is the default location for opening and storing files, by using the getwd() and setwd() commands. First, let us visualise the current default working directory.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/home/piet/Dropbox/work/UKDS/RGuide/UKDS_RGuide\"\n\n\nLet us say we would like the code from this guide to be all in a folder called ‘R_UKDS’, to be located in ‘My Documents’. To tell R to use the folder ’R_UKDS, we can either create it from within Windows or ask R to do it for us. So type: \nFor Windows: \n&gt; setwd(\"C:/Documents and Settings/&lt;INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE&gt;/My Documents/R_UKDS\") \nFor Mac:\n&gt; setwd(\"/Users/&lt;INSERT YOUR USERNAME HERE&gt;/Documents/R_UKDS\") \nFor Linux:\n\ndir.create(\"~/Documents/R_UKDS\")\nsetwd(\"~/Documents/R_UKDS\")\n\nTyping getwd() confirms that the change has been recorded. \n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/home/piet/Dropbox/work/UKDS/RGuide/UKDS_RGuide\"\n\n\nNotes:\n\nAny character string that is neither a command or the name of an object (such as a variable name) needs to be put between inverted commas or quotation marks, otherwise it will be interpreted as the name of an object\nsee the example below about loading user-created packages;\nEven when no parameters are specified for a command, brackets are compulsory as shown in the getwd() example above;\nR uses forward slashes rather than backslashes (unlike most other Windows applications) to separate directories. Using backlashes will return an error message;\nAlthough most R commands accept a large number of options to be specified, in many cases default values have been ‘factory set’ so that only the essential parameters need specifying.\n\nThe output of most R commands can be either directly displayed on the screen (as in the above example) or stored in objects that can be subsequently reused in further commands. This object-oriented feature separates R from traditional statistical software.\nFor instance, typing: \n&gt;   a&lt;-getwd()\nwill store the output of getwd() (that is, the name of the current default directory)  into an object called ‘a’. In order to view the content of a, one can just type its name: \n&gt;   a\n\n#### Writing R scripts via R Studio {-} Most users will want to write their code in a script file, similar to the ‘do’ file in Stata or syntax file in SPSS. R script files end with the .R suffix. To open an existing R script in RStudio select File&gt;Open File then the relevant script file. To create a new script select File&gt;New File&gt;Open File (shortcut: Control+Shift+N) this will open a new script window in which to type commands."

    "text": "2.4 Installing and loading packages\nApart from a basic set of commands and functions, most of the tools offered by R are available in packages that are not provided during the main installation and need to be installed and downloaded separately from within R. For example, to install the ‘foreign’ package one need to type:\ninstall.packages(\"foreign\",repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\nInstallation only needs to be done once. If the address of the package repository is not specified via the repos option, a pull-down menu will appear, asking for one. Choosing https://cloud.r-project.org will automatically select the closest mirror site.\nOriginally, Foreign enabled users to import Stata (version 12 or older) or SPSS datasets. For Stata datasets saved under version 13 and above, the haven or readstata13 package are required.\ninstall.packages(\"haven\",repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\nTo use a package already installed in the local R library, the library() command is needed:\n\nlibrary(foreign)\n\nSimply typing: \n&gt; library()\nWill list all libraries installed on the computer that can be loaded in memory. This can be a rather long list!\n\nBesides a full archive of R packages, the CRAN website provides a series of manuals, including Writing R Extensions, which describes how users can write their own packages and submit them to CRAN. \nOnce a package is installed, it will be permanently stored in the local R library on the computer, unless deleted it with the remove.packages() command (not advised as this can break dependencies between packages!).\n&gt; remove.packages(\"name of the package\")\nPackages required for an analysis have to be loaded every time a new R session is started (But not every time a syntax file is run!)."

    "text": "2.5 Getting help\nWithin R, the most straightforward way to request help with a command consists of a question mark followed by the command name, without a space in between. The standard help system in R (unless using RStudio or Eclipse) relies on the default web browser installed on your computer (ie Chrome, Firefox or Edge in most cases) to display pages. Typing:\n&gt; ?getwd \nIs equivalent of:\nhelp('getwd')\nand will open the help page for the getwd() command in the default web browser. If you are using RStudio or Eclipse, the help will most likely open in a new tab within the program.\nThis will work for any command directly available in the Base package that is loaded at startup or in other packages loaded via the library() command. Otherwise, R will return an error message.\nTyping two question marks followed by a keyword will search all of R for the available documentation for that keyword:\n\n ??foreign\n\nAn index of all commands and functions in the foreign package can be obtained by typing:\n\nhelp(package='foreign')\n\nNote: this command only works because the ‘foreign’ package was previously loaded in memory with the library() command. More information about where to find help when using R is provided at the end of this document."

    "section": "2.6 Objects",
    "text": "2.6 Objects\nR is an object oriented language, which means that almost any information it uses is stored as ‘objects’ (i.e. containers) that can be manipulated independently. During an R session, multiple objects are available simultaneously (for instance datasets, but also summary tables or new variables produced from it). Typing:\n&gt; ls()\nwill list all the objects that are currently in memory.\nObjects belong to classes or types which have distinct properties. There are many classes of objects in R. By comparison, Stata has only macros, variables and scalars that are directly available to most users. Common object classes include factors (these are equivalent to categorical variables), vectors (numerical variables – whether continuous or ordinal), data frames (datasets), matrices, etc. Not all operations are possible with all objects in R. More advanced users can also create their own object classes. Describing R objects and their properties is well beyond the purpose of this guide and users interested should consult the online documentation for further explanations. \nTo create or assign a value to an object, one uses the assignment operator (&lt;-). For example:\n&gt; x &lt;- 5 \nIn this example we have assigned the value 5 to an object called x. If you type the letter x, the value ‘5’ will be returned in your console. The object x will appear in the R environment after the ls() command.\n\nx &lt;- 5  \nx\n\n[1] 5\n\nls()\n\n[1] \"has_annotations\" \"x\"              \n\n\n\nDeleting objects\nThe rm() function can be used to remove objects from the environment (session). These objects can be variables, lists, datasets, etc. For instance, to remove the object ‘x’, or the fictitious dataset called ‘mydata’: \n\nrm(x)   \nls()\n\n[1] \"has_annotations\"\n\n\n&gt; rm(mydata)\n\n\n\n\n\nData frames\nAmong the various classes of objects one may use in R, a few are essential to understand when analysing survey data. Their characteristics are briefly listed below;\nData frames are objects that come closest to datasets or excel sheets in traditional statistical software. They are objects that have indexed rows and columns, both of which may have names. Data frames columns can be seen as variables and lines or rows as observations. Each cell in the data frame can be uniquely identified by its position. Data frames are typically the object in which survey datasets are stored.\nLet’s assume that we have a small data frame called ‘mydata’. Here are a few basic commands to examine it:\nDetermining the size of a data frame: the dim() command returns the number of rows and columns of a data frame\n\ndim(mydata)\n\n[1] 50  6\n\n\nR tells us that our data is made of 50 rows and 6 columns, in other words of 50 observations and 6 variables. What if I want a quick overview of the dataset?\n\nhead(mydata)\n\n    RSex skipmeal                   Married       Poverty1\n1 Female       NA Married/living as married        Was not\n2 Female        1        Separated/divorced        Was not\n3 Female       NA Married/living as married        Was not\n4   Male       NA             Never married        Was not\n5   Male        1             Never married        Was not\n6   Male       NA Married/living as married Was in poverty\n                          HEdQual3 NatFrEst\n1 Higher educ below degree/A level        5\n2 Higher educ below degree/A level       30\n3             O level or equiv/CSE       50\n4 Higher educ below degree/A level       50\n5                 No qualification       50\n6                             &lt;NA&gt;       10\n\n\nThe head() command displays the first six lines of the dataset. Depending on the number of variables the output of head() can become quickly overwhelming, as the size of the lines on most screens is limited!\nObtaining the names of variables (or columns) in the dataset: This can be done using either ls() which we already have used, or the names() commands. ls() returns the variables names, sorted alphabetically, whereas names() returns them in their actual order in the data frame.\n\nls(mydata)\n\n[1] \"HEdQual3\" \"Married\"  \"NatFrEst\" \"Poverty1\" \"RSex\"     \"skipmeal\"\n\nnames(mydata)\n\n[1] \"RSex\"     \"skipmeal\" \"Married\"  \"Poverty1\" \"HEdQual3\" \"NatFrEst\"\n\n\nWe can see that in the data frame, the “RSex” column comes in fact before “Poverty1”.\nAccessing variables:\nEach column of a data frame, or variable, can be accessed by its name preceded by the $ sign:\n\nmydata$NatFrEst\n\n [1]  5 30 50 50 50 10  1 NA  5 50 60 25 30  3 25 10 80  5 50 50 40 45  2 82 60\n[26] 40 10 10 40 15 30 30  2 10 75 99 70 50 10 30  1 10 85 45 70 25 40 30 10 25\nattr(,\"value.labels\")\nnamed numeric(0)\n\n\nAlternatively, columns/variables and rows can be identified numerically by their position in the data frame using square brackets:\ndataframe[row number,column number]\nGiven that RSex is the first column of our dataset\n\nmydata[,1]\n\n [1] Female Female Female Male   Male   Male   Male   Female Male   Male  \n[11] Male   Female Female Male   Female Female Female Female Female Female\n[21] Male   Female Female Male   Male   Female Female Female Female Male  \n[31] Female Female Female Female Male   Male   Female Female Male   Female\n[41] Male   Male   Female Male   Female Male   Female Female Female Male  \nLevels: Male Female\n\n\nReturns the same output as previously. Not specifying a row or column name within the square brackets tells R to display them all.\n\nmydata[6,]\n\n  RSex skipmeal                   Married       Poverty1 HEdQual3 NatFrEst\n6 Male       NA Married/living as married Was in poverty     &lt;NA&gt;       10\n\n\nReturns the values of all the variables for the sixth row of the data frame. Specifying both a row and column number, will return a unique observation:\n\nmydata[6,6]\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nwhich in this case is 10. Finally, more than one column or row can be displayed by concatenating their number using the c() function:\n\nmydata[c(6,9),c(1,6)]\n\n  RSex NatFrEst\n6 Male       10\n9 Male        5\n\n\nThe above command returns respectively the sixth and 9th observations for the sixth column. Please note that columns names can also be used instead of their number, provided that they are put between inverted commas:\n\nmydata[c(6,9),c('RSex','NatFrEst')]\n\n  RSex NatFrEst\n6 Male       10\n9 Male        5\n\n\nReturns the same result as previously. Having a data frame to hand allows us to explore other types of objects commonly found in R. The type of a variable can be displayed by simply using the class() function.\n\n\nNumeric\nNumeric objects are simple numerical vectors (ie a single or a list of numbers). Here this is the case for NatFrEst, the estimated proportion of people making wrong benefits claims, according to respondents to the survey.\n\nclass(mydata$NatFrEst)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\n\nCharacter\nCharacter objects are alphanumeric vectors, that is variables which consist of text string(s).\n\nclass(mydata$Married)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nFactors\nAn important feature of R is that categorical variables whether ordinal or polynomial are stored in objects known as factors. The main difference between factors and traditional categorical variables in Stata or SPSS is that they do not consist of discrete numerical values with which value labels are associated. They should be thought of instead as a special type of character variable with a discrete set of values, which are known as levels. In our data, Rsex (Gender of the respondent) is such an object:\n\nclass(mydata$RSex)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\nLet’s further examine this factor.\n\nlevels(mydata$RSex)\n\n[1] \"Male\"   \"Female\"\n\n\nreturns the levels (ie the values) of RSex. Even if ‘Male’ is the first level of Rsex, and female the second one, these do not correspond to underlying numbers in the data. Please also note that it is possible to change the ordering of factor levels with the factor() function. It is always a good idea to check the ordering of factor levels in a newly created variable.\n\nmydata$RSex.New&lt;-factor(mydata$RSex,levels = levels(mydata$RSex)[c(2,1)])\nlevels(mydata$RSex.New)\n\n[1] \"Female\" \"Male\"  \n\n\nThe above code tells R to create a new factor variable -RSex.New - whose levels are the same as the initial RSex, but with ‘Female’ coming first, and “Male”, second. The name of the new variable is arbitrary."

    "text": "3.1 Essential information\nIn principle, any dataset whether in CSV, SPSS, SAS, or Stata format can be opened by R. There are a number of issues to consider however:\n\nThe foreign package has been traditionally used to import SPSS and Stata datasets into R:\nits read.spss() and write.spss() functions respectively open and write .sav files. Given that both were developed from older versions of SPSS, it is therefore advised to check that their outcome is as expected. In addition:\nread.spss() does not store the data in a R data frame by default and will require the option to.data.frame=T to be specified.\nread.spss() may sometimes struggle with some numeric format and wrongly attempt to convert them as factor, which will result in error messages. It is therefore advised to limit the maximum number of levels that will be considered when converting factors by using the option max.value.labels=\nread.dta() and write.dta() respectively open and write Stata files up to version 12. An option to watch for is convert.factor=T/F which either will import Stata categorical variable as their underlying numeric value or instead will convert them into factors, using value labels as levels, which may be an issue for categorical variables with a large number of levels. Users have to bear in mind that the labels will by default sorted alphabetically.\nThe readstata13 package opens Stata datasets from version 13 onwards with the read.dta13() function and offers a more comprehensive set of options. convert.factor=T/F has the same effect as in read.dta() from foreign.\nData frames created with either read.dta() or read.dta13() have extra information stored as attributes, which maybe useful to retrieve. For instance:\n&gt; mydata&lt;-read.dta(\"Some_Stata_dataset.dta\")\n&gt; attributes(mydata)$var.labels ### Retrieves the original Stata variable labels\nFinally the haven package opens SPSS, Stata and SAS files with respectively read_spss(), read_dta() and read_sas(). By contrast with the other two packages, it relies on ad hoc data formats and data structures for converting labelled categorical variables and attempts to mimic Stata’s value and variable labels. More information is available here.\n\nIn order not to overcomplicate their initial exploration of R we recommend new users to use read.spss() or read.dta13() when importing datasets from either SPSS or Stata, rather than the more elaborate functions available in haven."

The “separated/divorced” and “Never married” categories of the “Married” variable are recoded as “Not partnered”. It is always advised to create new variables when recoding old ones so the original data is not tampered with.\n\nbsa$Married2 &lt;- ifelse(bsa$Married==\"Married/living as married\",\"Partnered\",bsa$Married)\nbsa$Married2 &lt;- ifelse(bsa$Married==\"Widowed\" | \n                       bsa$Married==\"Never married\" | \n                      bsa$Married==\"Separated/divorced\",\"Not partnered\",bsa$Married2)\n\ntable(bsa$Married2)\n\n\nNot partnered     Partnered \n         1778          2209 \n\n\nThe second and fourth categories have been renamed to ‘Not partnered’.

Let’s decompose it:\n\ndplyr use the pipe symbol ie %&gt;% which enables to sequentially combine functions. We will come back to this later in this guide.\nmutate() is the generic variable creation/alteration command, and can handle complex combinations of conditions as well as multiple simultaneous variable creation operations.\ncase_when() is the function that allows recoding numerical, character, or factor variables. On the left hand side of the tilde ~ are the condition or the values that need to be matched in the original variable , and on the right hand side, the attributed ie recoded values in the new variable. Note that in this case, the recoded variable is by default a character object and needs to be converted into a factor for easier manipulation.\n\nExtra tips:\n\nAs with any data manipulation exercise, caution is required, and it is recommended to create new variables with the recoded value rather than alter an original variable when handling missing values.\nThe standard value attribution command in R is &lt;-. However, = will also work in many cases.\nUnless explicitly specified (in our case, by adding the bsa$ prefix to variable name), the objects created are not included in the data frame from which they were computed."

    "section": "4.4 Missing Values",
    "text": "4.4 Missing Values\nExplicit missing values in R (ie values that R itself considers as missing) are represented as NA for factors and numerical variables. For character variables, missing values are simply empty strings, ie \"\". R has a series of functions specifically designed to handle NAs.\nR has fewer safety nets than other packages for handling missing values. Most function won’t issue warn users about whether or how many how many observations with missing values have been dropped. On the other hand, some commands will return error messages and won’t run when missing values are present. This is the case of mean() for example.\n\n4.4.1 Inspecting missing data\nThe logical function is.na() assesses each observation in variables and identifies whether cases are valid or missing. The result will appear as a boolean TRUE/FALSE vector for each observation. is.na() can be combined with other functions:\n\nWith table() in order to get the frequencies of missing values of a specific variable.\nWith sum() in order to count the number of missing observations of variables or whole datasets.\n\n\ntable(is.na(bsa$leftrigh))#of missing values in the leftright variable \n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n 3206   782 \n\nsum(is.na(bsa)) # of missing values in the whole dataset\n\n[1] 41486\n\nmean(is.na(bsa$leftrigh)) #returns the proportion of NAs...\n\n[1] 0.1960883\n\nmean(is.na(bsa)) # returns the proportion in the dataset\n\n[1] 0.3355712\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Recoding missing values as NA (continuous variables)\nIt may sometimes be useful to recode implicit missing values (ie considered by the data producer as missing, but not by R) of either numeric objects or factors into &lt;NA&gt;, in order to simplify case selection when conducting analyses. This can either be done with Base R code or the more advanced data manipulation functions from the dplyr package that we explored earlier.\nLet’s assume for a moment that we would like to get rid of respondents aged under 25 for our analysis. A safe way to proceed is by creating a new variable.\n\nbsa$RAgeCat2 &lt;- bsa$RAgeCat #duplicate variable\ntable(bsa$RAgeCat2)                      \n\n\n18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64   65+ \n  223   591   650   729   320   333  1138 \n\nbsa$RAgeCat2[bsa$RAgeCat2==\"18-24\" ] &lt;- NA #convert responses “18-24”  to NA\ntable(bsa$RAgeCat2)\n\n\n18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64   65+ \n    0   591   650   729   320   333  1138 \n\ntable(is.na(bsa$RAgeCat2))\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n 3761   227 \n\n\nWhy is the number of missing values 227 and not 223 as the original number of respondents aged 18-24? Because there were already 3 missing values for the RAgeCat variable.\nWe can also notice that although there are now no observation left in the 18-24 category, it is still displayed by table(). This is because levels are attributes of factors and are not deleted with observations. We can remove unused levels permanently with droplevels()\n\nbsa$RAgeCat2&lt;-droplevels(bsa$RAgeCat2)\ntable(bsa$RAgeCat2)\n\n\n25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64   65+ \n  591   650   729   320   333  1138 \n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Working with missing values\nExplicit missing values (coded as NA) can be taken care of by R’s own missing values functions. For instance using the na.rm=T or na.rm=TRUE option will remove missing values from an analysis (typing ?na.rm will provide more information). Below is a summary of how NAs are dealt with by common R commands:\n\n\n\nTreatment of missing values by R commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDefault action\nParameter\n\n\n\n\nmean(), sd(),median()\nIncludes NA (may return an error)\nna.rm=T\n\n\ncor(),cov()\nIncludes NA (may return an error)\nuse=“complete.obs”\n\n\ntable()\nExcludes NA\nuseNA = “always” to display NAs\n\n\nxtabs()\nExcludes NA\naddNA = T to display NAs\n\n\nlm(),glm()\nExcludes NA\nna.action=NULL"

Suppose we would like to examine the interest for politics among people aged 18-24.\nWe can either create an adhoc data frame:\n\ntable(bsa$Politics)\n\n\n... a great deal,      quite a lot,             some,    not very much, \n              739               982              1179               708 \n or, none at all? \n              379 \n\nbsa.young&lt;-bsa[bsa$RAgeCat==\"18-24\",]  \ntable(bsa.young$Politics)\n\n\n... a great deal,      quite a lot,             some,    not very much, \n               29                41                72                56 \n or, none at all? \n               25 \n\nbsa.young&lt;-bsa[bsa$RAgeCat==\"18-24\",]\n\nOr we can directly limit the extent of the analysis on the go:\n\n  table(bsa$Politics[bsa$RAgeCat==\"18-24\"])\n\n\n... a great deal,      quite a lot,             some,    not very much, \n               29                41                72                56 \n or, none at all? \n               25 \n\n\nIn the first example it was necessary to include a comma after specg the condition. This is meant to indicate that we want to retain all variables ie columns in the dataset. The comma is not necessary in the second example as we are already working with a single variable.\nUsing dplyr*\nNow suppose we want to further restrict the analysis to people identifying as Males. We could use the same Base R syntax as above, but with more than one condition coding tends to become cumbersome. We could instead use the more convenient syntax from the dplyr package. Either:\n\nbsa.young.males&lt;-bsa%&gt;%filter(RAgeCat==\"18-24\" & Rsex==\"Male\")  \ntable(bsa.young.males$Politics)\n\n\n... a great deal,      quite a lot,             some,    not very much, \n               15                22                30                18 \n or, none at all? \n                9 \n\n\nOr. as before embed it as a condition within table() :\n\n  table(bsa%&gt;%filter(RAgeCat==\"18-24\" & Rsex==\"Male\")%&gt;%select(Politics) )\n\nPolitics\n... a great deal,      quite a lot,             some,    not very much, \n               15                22                30                18 \n or, none at all? \n                9 \n\n\nWe are now equipped with the necessary information to move to the next stage and carry out basic analysis using R."

    "text": "5.1 Continuous variables\nProducing descriptive statistics in R is relatively straightforward, as key functions are included by default in the Base package. We have already seen above that the summary() command provides essential information about a variable. For instance,\n\nsummary(bsa$leftrigh)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n   1.00    2.00    2.40    2.52    3.00    5.00     782 \n\n\nprovides information about the mean, median and quartiles of the political scale of respondents.\nThe describe() command from the Hmisc package provides a more detailed set of summary statistics.\n\nlibrary(Hmisc)\ndescribe(bsa$leftrigh)\n\nbsa$leftrigh \n       n  missing distinct     Info     Mean      Gmd      .05      .10 \n    3206      782       30    0.993     2.52   0.8831      1.2      1.4 \n     .25      .50      .75      .90      .95 \n     2.0      2.4      3.0      3.6      4.0 \n\nlowest : 1    1.2  1.4  1.5  1.6 , highest: 4.4  4.6  4.75 4.8  5   \n\n\ndescribe() also provides the number of observations (including missing and unique observations), deciles as well as the five largest and smallest values.\nCommands producing single statistics are also available:\n\nmean(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 2.519911\n\nsd(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 0.7852958\n\nmedian(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 2.4\n\nmax(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 5\n\nmin(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nWe could combine the output from the above commands into a single line using the c() function:\n\nc(\n  mean(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T),\n  sd(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T),\n  median(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T),\n  max(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T),\n  min(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm = T)\n)\n\n[1] 2.5199106 0.7852958 2.4000000 5.0000000 1.0000000\n\n\nAs we saw previously, the na.rm = T option prevents missing values from being taken into account (in which case the output would have been NA, as this is the default behaviour of these functions). Using these individual commands may come in handy, for instance when further processing of the result is needed:\n\nm &lt;- mean(bsa$leftrigh, na.rm= T)\n\nLet’s round the results to two decimal places:\n\nrm &lt;- round(m,2)\n\nWe can see the final results by typing:\n\nrm\n\n[1] 2.52\n\n\nNote:\n\nround(mean(bsa$leftrigh,na.rm=T),2)\n\n[1] 2.52\n\n\nwould produce the same results using just one line of code ."

The cor() and cov() functions provide basic measures of association between two variables.

It can be translated to mean ’an increase in authoritarianism is associated with a marginal increase in rightwing views.\nNote: When using the cor() and cov() functions missing values are dealt with the ‘use=’ “everything”, “all.obs”, “complete.obs”, “na.or.complete”, or “pairwise.complete.obs” options.

    "section": "5.3 Categorical Variables",
    "text": "5.3 Categorical Variables\nAs with continuous variables, R offers several tools that can be used to describe the distribution of categorical variables. One- and two-way contingency tables are the most commonly used.\n\n5.3.1 One way frequency tables\nThere are several R commands that we can use to create frequency tables. The most common ones table(),xtabs() or ftable() which return the frequencies of observations within each level of a factor. For example, in order to obtain the political affiliation of BSA respondents in 2017:\n\ntable(bsa$PartyId2)\n\n\n    Conservative           Labour Liberal Democrat      Other party \n            1263             1479              241              193 \n            None      Green Party \n             515               79 \n\n\nAs with any other R functions, the outcome of table() can be stored as an object for further processing:\n\na&lt;-table(bsa$PartyId2)\n\ntable() does not compute proportions or percentages. Proportions are obtained using the prop.table() function which in turn does not produce percentages. It is also a good idea to round the results for greater readability. Either:\n\nround(100*prop.table(a),1) \n\n\n    Conservative           Labour Liberal Democrat      Other party \n            33.5             39.2              6.4              5.1 \n            None      Green Party \n            13.7              2.1 \n\n\n… or:\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(\n          table(bsa$PartyId2)\n        ),\n      1)\n\n\n    Conservative           Labour Liberal Democrat      Other party \n            33.5             39.2              6.4              5.1 \n            None      Green Party \n            13.7              2.1 \n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Two way or more contingency table\nThe simplest way to produce a two-way contingency table is to pass another variable to table():\n\ntable(bsa$PartyId2, bsa$Rsex)\n\n                  \n                   Male Female\n  Conservative      627    636\n  Labour            644    835\n  Liberal Democrat  124    117\n  Other party        97     96\n  None              199    316\n  Green Party        31     48\n\n\nHowever, when dealing with more than one variable it is recommended to use xtabs() instead as it has a number of desirable functions directly available as option. The syntax is slightly different as it relies on a formula ie a R object consisting of elements separated by a tilde ‘~’. The variables to be tabulated are specified on the right hand side of the formula.\n\nxtabs(~PartyId2 +Rsex,\n      data = bsa)\n\n                  Rsex\nPartyId2           Male Female\n  Conservative      627    636\n  Labour            644    835\n  Liberal Democrat  124    117\n  Other party        97     96\n  None              199    316\n  Green Party        31     48\n\n\nThe data= parameter does not have to be explicitly specified as simply using ´bsa’ will work. Other useful options are:\n\nsubset=, which allows direct specification of a subpopulation from which to derive the table;\ndrop.unused.levels=T to remove empty levels (categories with zero observations) from being displayed;\nweights~ variables on the right hand side of the formula will be treated as weights, a useful feature for survey analysis.\n\nAs previously prop.table() is necessary in order to obtain proportions:\n\nb&lt;-xtabs(~PartyId2 +Rsex,bsa)\nround(100*prop.table(b),1) ### Cell percentages\n\n                  Rsex\nPartyId2           Male Female\n  Conservative     16.6   16.9\n  Labour           17.1   22.1\n  Liberal Democrat  3.3    3.1\n  Other party       2.6    2.5\n  None              5.3    8.4\n  Green Party       0.8    1.3\n\n\nThe largest group in the sample (22.1%) is made of labour-voting females, the smallest of green-voting males.\n\nround(100*prop.table(b,1),1) ### Option 1 for row percentages\n\n                  Rsex\nPartyId2           Male Female\n  Conservative     49.6   50.4\n  Labour           43.5   56.5\n  Liberal Democrat 51.5   48.5\n  Other party      50.3   49.7\n  None             38.6   61.4\n  Green Party      39.2   60.8\n\n\nConservative voters are more or less evenly split between men and women, whereas Labour and Green voters are more likely to be women.\n\nround(100*prop.table(b,2),1) ### Option 2 for column percentages\n\n                  Rsex\nPartyId2           Male Female\n  Conservative     36.4   31.1\n  Labour           37.4   40.8\n  Liberal Democrat  7.2    5.7\n  Other party       5.6    4.7\n  None             11.6   15.4\n  Green Party       1.8    2.3\n\n\nSimilar proportions of men voted Conservative and Labour (36-37%), whereas women were clearly more likely to vote Labour.\nFor some reason, there is not a straightforward way to obtain percentages in three-way contingency tables with either xtabs() or table().

    "text": "6.2 Robust inference\nThe weighting procedures described above could be described as ‘quick and dirty’ in that they mostly compute point estimates – ie a single value – and do not provide a reliable idea of their precision. Computing the precision of survey data estimates – usually via their standard error – usually requires more than just adding weights to a command. Information about the survey design, its primary sampling units, strata and clusters is requires so that robust standard errors, statistical tests and/or confidence interval are computed.\nThe Survey package was designed in order to deal with this set of issues. It provides functions for integrating survey design into R as well as computing common estimates. We describe below the most important features. In order to use survey fonctions consist one first needs to create a svydesign object, in essence a version of the data that incorporates the sample design information available, then to compute the estimate using the svydesign object.\nAn common issue with survey datasets available in the UK is that sampling information is often only available in secure lab version of the data, restricting its access to authorised users. Although it is sometimes possible to use available variables to account for aspects of the sample design – region as a strata in the case of stratified samples – in most cases users are left with computing standard errors without sample design information, which amounts to assuming that the sample was drawn purely at random. Even if this is the case however, using the survey package is recommended, as it provides a coherent framework for computing survey parameters.\n\nlibrary(survey) ### Loading the package in memory\nbsa.design&lt;-svydesign(ids =~1,weights=~WtFactor,data=bsa) \n\nThe code above simply declares the survey design by creating the bsa.design object (the name is arbitrary). The ids= parameter is where primary sampling units are declared, as well as any clustering information as a formula ie ~PSU+cluster2id.... When PSU information is unavailable ids is given the value 1 or 0. A strata= and fpc= are available in order to declare the sampling strata and the variable used for finite population correction. None of these are available in the bsa dataset, and estimation commands will therefore rely on the assumption of simple random sampling.\nWe can now compute estimates similar estimates as in the previous sections. The code below provides the mean of the left vs right political orientation indicator, as well as its 95% confidence interval:\n\nsvymean(~leftrigh,bsa.design,na.rm = T)### Computes the mean and its standard error...\n\n           mean     SE\nleftrigh 2.5216 0.0155\n\nconfint(svymean(~leftrigh,bsa.design,na.rm = T)) ### ... and confidence interval\n\n            2.5 %   97.5 %\nleftrigh 2.491277 2.551902\n\n\nAnd now for the median:\n\nsvyquantile(~leftrigh,bsa.design,quantiles=.5,na.rm = T)\n\n$leftrigh\n    quantile ci.2.5 ci.97.5         se\n0.5      2.4    2.4     2.6 0.05100208\n\nattr(,\"hasci\")\n[1] TRUE\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"newsvyquantile\"\n\n\nFrequency and contingency tables are computed using svytable(), which follows the same syntax as xtabs()\n\n### A frequency table...\nround(100*\n        prop.table(\n          svytable(~RAgeCat,bsa.design)\n        ),1)\n\nRAgeCat\n18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-59 60-64   65+ \n 11.2  17.2  16.1  17.9   7.9   6.8  22.8 \n\n### And a two-way contingency table:\n\nround(100*\n        prop.table(\n          svytable(~RAgeCat+Rsex,bsa.design)\n          ,1),1)\n\n       Rsex\nRAgeCat Male Female\n  18-24 51.1   48.9\n  25-34 50.2   49.8\n  35-44 49.7   50.3\n  45-54 49.3   50.7\n  55-59 48.8   51.2\n  60-64 49.0   51.0\n  65+   45.4   54.6"

The ggplot package provides one of the most advanced set of tools for plotting data currently available. A few examples are provided below.\nPolitical party affiliation by highest qualification and gender We would like to look at how differences in political party affiliations vary by gender and whether respondents have a degree-level education.\nLet us first prepare the data: we need to create the table of result, the proportion of degree vs non degree holders by gender and political party. This is a three-way contingency table, that we can obtain with ftable() as shown in Section 5.2, combined with prop.table() for the computation of proportions and round(). As they are more straightforward to handle in ggplot, we convert the table object created by ftable into a data frame. Although we can specify titles and axis labels in the plotting command, it is preferable to keep things simple here and have them already in the the data.\nRather than using the full range of educational achievements recorded in HEdQual3, we would like instead to have a dichotomic variable between degree holders and non degree holders. Adding it directly in the ftable command as a boolean expression return a dichotomic variable: “TRUE” for Degree educated respondents, and “FALSE” for everyone else. We just need to change the levels of this factor variable to make them more intelligible. Finally we change the variable names in our data frame.\n\npa&lt;-round(100*prop.table((ftable(bsa$PartyId2,bsa$Rsex,(bsa$HEdQual3==\"Degree\"))),1),1)\npa&lt;-data.frame(pa)\nlevels(pa$Var3)&lt;-c(\"Below\",\"Degree\")\nnames(pa)&lt;-c(\"Affiliation\",\"Gender\",\"Education\",\"Percent\")\npa\n\n   Affiliation Gender Education Percent\n1          Con   Male     Below    72.7\n2          Lab   Male     Below    70.1\n3     Lib Dems   Male     Below    50.0\n4        Other   Male     Below    86.5\n5         None   Male     Below    88.8\n6       Greens   Male     Below    43.3\n7          Con Female     Below    82.6\n8          Lab Female     Below    67.3\n9     Lib Dems Female     Below    54.4\n10       Other Female     Below    74.7\n11        None Female     Below    83.9\n12      Greens Female     Below    48.9\n13         Con   Male    Degree    27.3\n14         Lab   Male    Degree    29.9\n15    Lib Dems   Male    Degree    50.0\n16       Other   Male    Degree    13.5\n17        None   Male    Degree    11.2\n18      Greens   Male    Degree    56.7\n19         Con Female    Degree    17.4\n20         Lab Female    Degree    32.7\n21    Lib Dems Female    Degree    45.6\n22       Other Female    Degree    25.3\n23        None Female    Degree    16.1\n24      Greens Female    Degree    51.1\n\n\nWe are now ready to plot the data. the ggplot() commands usually works as a succession of layers or options that are added to an initial plot specifications. Each extra layer is added after a + sign. In the example below, we specify the data and the aesthetic (ie the main parameters of the plot) with the first command: the x and y variables , and the first grouping variable, education). geom_bar() stipulates the bar plot, with the ṕosition=“dodge” for the bars to be located side by side (position=“stack”would have them on top of each other). Finally, facet_wrap() splits the plot by gender.\n\nggplot(data=pa,aes(y=Percent,x=Affiliation,fill=Education))+\n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  theme_minimal()+                  ### Theme for visualisation\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#702082\", \"#008755\"))+ ### Custom colours (optional)\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")"

    "text": "8.1 Differences between means\nTwo common ways of conducting statistical testing with means in samples consist in testing whether they are significantly different from 0 (one sample t-test), or whether they differ between two groups (two samples t test). In the latter case, one can further distinguish between independent samples (where means come from different groups), or paired samples (when the same measure is taken at several point in time). Given that it is the most widely used in social science, we will only cover the former here.\nSeveral R packages provide functions for conducting t tests. We will be using t.test(), part the stats package. Suppose we would like to test whether libauth significantly differs between men and women. A two sided test is the default (with H_0 that there is no differences between groups), and H_1 that the group means do indeed differ. The test is specified with a formula with on the left hand side the quantity to be tested and on the right hand side the grouping variable.\nOne sided tests can be conducted by specifying that the alternative hypothesis (H_1) is either greater or less. t.test() assumes that by default the variances are unequal. this can be changed with the var.equal=T option.\n\n# Testing for significant differences in liberal vs authoritarian score\nt.test(libauth~Rsex,data=bsa)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  libauth by Rsex\nt = 1.1622, df = 3011.9, p-value = 0.2452\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.02035161  0.07959393\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group Male mean in group Female \n            3.527793             3.498172 \n\n\nNo significant differences (ie the difference in libauth between men and women is not significantly different from zero)\n\n# Testing for whether men have a lower (ie more left-wing)  score\nt.test(leftrigh~Rsex,data=bsa, alternative=\"less\")      \n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  leftrigh by Rsex\nt = -2.0687, df = 2858, p-value = 0.01933\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Male and group Female is less than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n        -Inf -0.01197607\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group Male mean in group Female \n            2.487564             2.546087 \n\n\nMen have a significantly lower score on the scale (at the .05 threshold) and are therefore on average leaning more to the left than women."

Let’s first briefly explore the variables using the class() and table() commands from the previous chapters:\n\nclass(bsa$Voted)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\ntable(bsa$Voted)\n\n\n Yes   No \n2205  776 \n\n\nand\n\nclass(bsa$HEdQual3)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\ntable(bsa$HEdQual3)\n\n\n                          Degree Higher educ below degree/A level \n                            1050                             1086 \n            O level or equiv/CSE                 No qualification \n                            1026                              747 \n\n\nIt is a good idea to make sure that categorical variables are stored as factors. This is not absolutely necessary, but gives greater flexibility, for instance when having to change the reference category on the go.\nFor greater readability we can also shorten the levels of HEdQual3 using the level() function:\n\nlevels(bsa$HEdQual3) ### The original level names  are a bit verbose...\n\n[1] \"Degree\"                           \"Higher educ below degree/A level\"\n[3] \"O level or equiv/CSE\"             \"No qualification\"                \n\n### ...

By default, the first level of a factor will be used as the reference category. This can be also checked with the contrasts(). In this case, 1 is associated with ‘No’, so the model will be predicting the probability of NOT voting. If the 1 was associated with ‘Yes’ then the model will be predicting the probability of voting.\n\nlevels(bsa$Voted) #Note that Yes comes before No\n\n[1] \"Yes\" \"No\" \n\ncontrasts(bsa$Voted)\n\n    No\nYes  0\nNo   1\n\n\nAs we are interested in the latter we need to change the reference category using the relevel() function. We can also create a new variable named Voted2 so as to keep a copy of the original variable intact.\n\n# Reverse the order\nbsa$Voted2 &lt;- relevel(bsa$Voted, ref = \"No\")\n\n#Check the contrasts\ncontrasts(bsa$Voted2)\n\n    Yes\nNo    0\nYes   1\n\n\nSince the outcome variable (Voted or Voted2) has a binomial distribution, we need to specify to the glm() function that we will be fitting a logistic regression model.

Please refer to the package documentation for more detailed explanations.\nRaw logistic regression coefficients measure the effect of variables on the probability of the outcome such as log(betaX)=P(y). It is common practice to convert these into odd ratios by exponentiating them, such as that betaX=exp(P(y)). The following code does this in R:\n\ncbind(\n  exp(coef(fit2)),exp(confint(fit2))\n) \n\n                                        2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept)               3.0419750 2.0618311  4.5276614\nHEdQual3A level and above 0.6792550 0.5237628  0.8795335\nHEdQual3GCSE or equiv     0.3714919 0.2868078  0.4796010\nHEdQual3No Qual           0.1486366 0.1089442  0.2015607\nRsexFemale                0.8546343 0.7130680  1.0235515\nRAgeCat25-34              0.7818917 0.5300310  1.1469983\nRAgeCat35-44              1.2295882 0.8316608  1.8095457\nRAgeCat45-54              2.3557310 1.5886305  3.4827615\nRAgeCat55-59              2.3178122 1.4718049  3.6621685\nRAgeCat60-64              4.9667132 3.0428167  8.2090111\nRAgeCat65+                8.7065916 5.7183039 13.2696921\n\n\nUsing the coef() and confint() functions, the code above respectively extracts the coefficients and associated 95% confidence intervals from fit2 then collate them using cbind().\n** Plotting the coefficients ** –&gt; We can visualise the odd ratios and their confidence intervals using the plot.model() function from the ‘sjPlot’ package. The ’sjPlot’ package needs to be installed and loaded\ninstall.packages('sjPlot')\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nset_theme(base = theme_minimal()) ### Default sets of options \nplot_model(fit2,\n           colors = c(\"#702082\", \"#008755\") ### Added for better accessibility \n) \n\n\n\n\nAssessing model fit The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a measure of relative fit for maximum likelihood fitted models. It is used to compare the improvement in how several models fit some data relative to each other, allowing for the different number of parameters or degrees of freedom. The smaller the AIC, the better the fit. In order for the comparison to be valid, we need to ensure that the models were run with the same number of observations each time. As it is likely that the second model was run on a smaller sample, due to missing values for the Age and Sex variables, we will need to re-run the first one without.\n\nfit1 &lt;- glm(Voted2 ~ HEdQual3, data=bsa%&gt;%\n              filter(!is.na(Rsex) & !is.na(RAgeCat)), family=binomial(link=logit))\n\nc(fit1$aic,fit2$aic)\n\n[1] 3244.507 2944.535\n\n\nWe can see that the model controlling for gender and sex is a better fit to the data than the one without controls as it has an AIC of 2944.5 against 3244.5 for fit1.\nWith the information about the deviance from fit1 and fit2, we can also compute the overall significance of the model, that is whether the difference between the deviance (another likelihood-based measure of fit) for the fitted model is significantly different from that of the empty or null model. This is usually carried by conducting a chi square test, accounting for the differences in the number of parameters (ie degrees of freedom) between the two models. As with other R code, this can achieved step by step or in one go:\n\ndev.d&lt;-fit2$null.deviance - fit2$deviance \ndf.d&lt;-fit2$df.null - fit2$df.residual\np&lt;-1 - pchisq(dev.d, df.d)\nc(dev.d,df.d,p)\n\n[1] 370.5486  10.0000   0.0000\n\n\nThe Chi square test indicates that the difference in deviance of 370.5 with 10 degrees of freedom is highly significant (P&lt;.001)"

The packages ‘lme4’ and ‘nlme’ are used to fit respectively linear and non linear multilevel models, also known as mixed models.\nComplex survey data and analysis commands and functions can be found in the ‘survey’ package. It includes commands for taking into account stratified and clustered samples, weights compute design effects and confidence intervals, etc..\nFor users interested in latent variable modelling the factanal() command from the stats package conducts factor analysis. Other resources are available in the poLCA (Latent Class Analysis), ltm (Latent Trait modelling), sem (Structural equation modelling) packages. The Lavaan package aslso provides a wide range of functions for structural equation modelling including with categorical outcomes.\nUsers interested in longitudinal and time series analysis will be interested in the statsand the ‘tseries’ packages. The packages survival and eha deal with event history and survival analysis, whereas ‘grofit’ and ‘plm’ are designed for panel data and growth analyses."
